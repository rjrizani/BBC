Three American goods that could rise in price due to metal tariffs,"A 25% tax on all imports of steel and aluminium into the UScame into effect on Wednesday, ending exemptions from the rules for goods from major trade partners including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, as well as the European Union.
The expanded tariff measures announced by President Donald Trump mean many US businesses wanting to bring the metals into the country now have to pay more.
Trump has already imposed separate 25% tariffs on other imports from Mexico and Canada, but almost immediately announced an exemption for carmakers and some other goods. He also placed a 20% levy on other Chinese goods.
The European Union says it will impose counter-measures on €26bn (£21.9bn, $28.3bn) worth of US goods in response.
There is a risk that the companies will pass on these added costs, or some portion of them, to consumers.
Since steel and aluminium are key components in many goods, what items could get more expensive?
About 70% of the steel used in the US to make cans for food is imported today, coming in from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, according to the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI), a business group representing can-makers.
After Trump ordered tariffs on steel in 2018, many can-makers won ""exclusions"" from those import taxes, over the objections of steelmakers, given the limited production of the type of steel used to make cans in the US.
Since then, steel manufacturers have cut production further, pushing up prices, warned the CMI, which sent a letter to the Trump administration earlier this month signed by big food companies including General Mills, Del Monte and Goya.
Robert Budway, president of the CMI, said without exemptions for can manufacturers to import steel tariff free, grocery prices for canned foods made in the US are likely to rise.
""While the president may believe that these tariffs are protecting the steel industry, they certainly are undermining our food security and our supply resiliency for American canned food, which Americans rely on every day,"" Mr Budway said.
When it comes to aluminium, brewers and makers of fizzy drinks, such as Coca-Cola, have also warned the move will add costs and could lead to higher prices for customers.
""We control enough variables that we can adapt and mitigate our way through what is happening,"" Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey told investors this week.
Trump has said there will be no exemptions from the rules this time, either for individual products or for particular countries,  however some sectors are hoping he will row back from that position.
After Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium during his first term, carmakers including Ford and General Motors warned the measures would add about $1bn to each of their costs.
For customers, Morningstar estimated the tariff costs back then would result in a roughly 1%, or a $300 price rise for customers.
David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, warned Ford could be facing a similar cost increase this time, but said it was unclear how consumers will be affected.
Affordability pressures in a market where sales have yet to return to 2019 levels could limit how much of the costs companies choose to pass on, according to Michael Wall, an auto analyst at S&P Global Mobility.
But he said it was still ""realistic"" to expect some of the costs from the metals tariffs to trickle down to buyers.
However he noted that Trump's announcement of tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, currently on hold until March, would have a much bigger impact for buyers.
At a business conference, Ford chief executive Jim Farley warned Trump's recent moves were causing ""a lot of cost and a lot of chaos"" for his industry.
TD Economics has estimated cars could go up in price by about $3,000 if blanket tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada came into force.

The construction industry as a sector is one of the single biggest users of steel, which developers and homebuilders need for everything from building frames to appliances.
Carl Harris, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said the decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium ran ""totally counter"" to Trump's stated goal of making housing more affordable, warning it would raise costs and deter development and rebuilding.
""Ultimately, consumers will pay for these tariffs in the form of higher home prices,"" he warned.
The National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs.
After Trump imposed steel tariffs in 2018, appliance maker Whirlpool faced an unexpected $350m jump in costs it said was driven by the increase in steel prices.
Companies unable to absorb such costs would likely pass them on through higher prices in the shops.

US education department plans to cut half its workforce,"The US Department of Education is planning to cut about half of its workforce, as the Trump administration works to slash the size of the federal government.
The mass layoffs will affect nearly 2,100 people who are set to be placed on leave from 21 March.
Trump has long sought to eliminate the department, a long-cherished goal of some conservatives, but such an action would require approval by Congress.
The department, which has an annual budget of around $238bn (£188bn), employs more than 4,000 people.
Established in 1979,the department overseesfunding for public schools, administers student loans and runs programmes that help low-income students.
But Trump has accused the agency of ""indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material"".
A common misconception is that the department operates US schools and sets curricula - that is done by states and local districts.
And a relatively small percentage of funding for primary and secondary schools  - about 13% - comes from federal funds. The majority is made up from states and local groups.
The agency also plays a prominent role in administering and overseeing the federal student loans used by millions of Americans to pay for higher education.
""As part of the Department of Education's final mission, the department today initiated a reduction in force impacting nearly 50% of the department's workforce,"" a statement from Education Secretary Linda McMahon said on Tuesday.
She said the cuts would impact all divisions in the department and were made to ""better serve students, parents, educators, and taxpayers"".
The agency had 4,133 employees when Trump was sworn into office, an announcement from the department states. It has the smallest staff of all the 15 US cabinet-level agencies.
After the cuts, 2,183 people would remain, which included several hundred who retired or accepted a buyout programme earlier this year, the agency said.
The notice to employees said that all of those who are laid off would continue to receive their normal pay and benefits until 9 June, as well as a severance package or retirement pay based on how long they'd worked at the department.
""The Department of Education will continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency's purview, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students, and competitive grantmaking,"" the email states.
Reports have suggested that Trump, for weeks, has considered signing an executive order impacting the Department of Education, though he has not yet done so.
Several of his executive orders have been met with lawsuits, as have Trump's dramatic cuts at agencies around Washington.
Several lawsuits have also challenged actions by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), a team aiming to slash government spending that's being led by Elon Musk. The agency has installed deputies at various agencies, slashed staff and accessed data across the government.
For decades, Republicans have floated the idea of axing the Education Department. When Ronald Reagan ran for president in 1980, he pushed for its dismantling.
It hasn't been done because it would take anact of Congress to accomplish, which in the current makeup would mean Trump would need Democratic support.
Many conservatives have pointed to decentralising education and giving states and local governments more power.
The American Federation of Teachers, the nation's most powerful education union, condemned the cuts to the department in a statement.
""The massive reduction in force at the Education Department is an attack on opportunity that will gut the agency and its ability to support students, throwing federal education programs into chaos across the country,"" the union's president Randi Weingarten said.
She called for Congress and the courts to intervene.
"
UK to 'keep options open' as Trump tariffs kick in,"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK will ""keep all options on the table"" as US President Donald Trump's tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium kick in.
The UK exports hundreds of millions of pounds worth of steel to the US per year, which will be subject to the 25% levy.
Sir Keir said the UK was taking a ""pragmatic"" approach and was pushing for a trade deal, but the Conservatives said Labour had ""no plan"" as steelmakers raised concerns about cheap steel being redirected to the UK because of the US tariffs.
In contrast to the UK, the EU said on Wednesday it would impose counter-tariffs on €26bn (£22bn) of US goods.
When Sir Keir visited the White House last month, trade was high on the agenda, with thePM seeking a trade deal and exemptions to Trump's tariffs.
It is understood tariffs were also discussed during a phone call between Sir Keir and Trump on Monday.
However, as the latest tariffs take effect, there were no exemptions for any country.
Trump hopes the tariffs will boost US steel and aluminium production, but critics say it will raise prices for US consumers and dent economic growth.
US markets sank on Monday and Tuesdayas traders and analysts expressed recession fears.
The tariffs introduced on Wednesday mean US businesses wanting to bring steel and aluminium into the country will have to pay a 25% tax on them.
These costs will probably be passed on to US consumers.
European Union President Ursula von der Leyen said tariffs ""bring uncertainty for the economy. Jobs are at stake, prices up, nobody needs that, on both sides, neither in the EU or the US.""
She said the EU's retaliatory tariffs were ""strong but proportionate"" and that the EU remains ""open to negotiations"".
The EU tariffs will be imposed on ""products ranging from boats to bourbon to motorbikes,""the EU said. They will be partially introduced on 1 April and fully in place on 13 April.
Gareth Stace, director general at industry body UK Steel, said the US move was ""hugely disappointing"" and urged the US to work with the UK rather than against it.
Some steel company contracts have already been cancelled or been put on hold, he said, adding that customers in the US would have to pay £100m per year extra in the tax.
He said tariffs imposed by the US could mean cheap international steel flooding the UK market, putting more pressure on domestic producers.
Unite general secretary Sharon Graham called on the government to ""act decisively to protect the steel industry, adding the public sector should ""always buys UK produced steel"".
The Community union called for UK taxes on carbon-intensive steel, which would include metal produced in China and India.
In 2024, UK steel and aluminium exports to the US were a relatively small part of the UK economy, worth £474m and £225m respectively, according to industry group the Aluminium Federation.
But Trump's tariffs also cover products made with steel and aluminium, and that's a bigger chunk of trade - about £2.2bn, or about 5% of UK exports to the US last year.
For some suppliers of speciality steel products the US makes up a large proportion of their overall business.
Philip Jackson, the managing director of Bright Steels, a hundred-year-old family firm which employs 75 people in Malton, North Yorkshire, said tariffs may lead to customers in the US reducing their orders.
He said it won't hit jobs but it might affect profits and the company's ability to invest in the future.
Sir Keir's comments in Prime Minister's Questions came in response to Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who called for the UK to be ""more robust"" with the US president ""like the Europeans and like the Canadians"".
Sir Keir said: ""I'm disappointed to see global tariffs in relation to steel and aluminium. We will take a pragmatic approach.""
Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said Labour ""can't even get themselves in the room"" to negotiate with the US"".
However, in the US, some welcomed the tariffs, with the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) lobby group saying they will create jobs, boost US steel manufacturing, and close a system of exemptions, exclusions and quotas that allowed foreign producers to avoid tariffs.
In 2018, during his first term as president, Trump imposed import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium, but carve-outs were eventually negotiated for many countries.
This time the Trump administration said there will be no exemptions.
The US is a major importer of aluminium and steel, and Canada, Mexico and Brazil are among its largest suppliers.
On Tuesday,Trump u-turned on doubling the tariffs on Canada specificallyin response to a surcharge Ontario had placed on electricity.
Others in the US do not support the tariffs.
Michael DiMarino runs Linda Tool, a Brooklyn company that makes parts for the aerospace industry. Everything he makes involves some kind of steel, much of which comes from American mills.
""If I have higher prices, I pass them on to my customers. They have higher prices, they pass it on to the consumer,"" Mr DiMarino said, adding that he supports the call for increased manufacturing in the US but warning the president's moves could backfire.
The American Automotive Policy Council, a group that represents car giants such Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, said they ""are concerned that specifically revoking exemptions for Canada and Mexico will add significant costs"" to car makers' suppliers.
Bill Reinsch, a former Commerce Department official, said the tariffs could help the US steel and aluminium industries but hurt the wider economy by making products more expensive.
Meanwhile, research firm Oxford Economics said in a report it had lowered its US growth forecast for the year from 2.4% to 2% and made even steeper adjustments to its outlook for Canada and Mexico.

Trump says anti-Tesla protesters will face 'hell',"People protesting against Tesla should be labelled domestic terrorists, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday at a White House media event designed to bolster Elon Musk's electric car company.
Trump sat in the driver's seat of a brand new red Tesla that he said he planned to buy, with Musk in the passenger seat, but did not test drive it.
Demonstrators have targeted Tesla showrooms in recent weeks in protest against Musk's cost-cutting role in Trump's administration.
Trump said they were ""harming a great American company"", and anyone using violence against the electric carmaker would ""go through hell"".
The president described the shiny red Model-S, one of a number of Teslas lined up on the White House drive, as ""beautiful"" but said he was no longer allowed to drive and so would keep the car for the use of White House staff. Current and former presidents are not allowed to drive for security reasons.
He also said he would not want to buy a self-driving model, which Musk said would reach the market next year.
The showcase for Tesla's cars outside the White House came after Tesla's market value halved since its all-time peak in December, sliding 15% in a single day on Monday, before recovering slightly on Tuesday.
Trump said he had told Musk, ""You know, Elon, I don't like what's happening to you, and Tesla's a great company.""
Musk, Trump's top donor in the election campaign, has been tasked with radically cutting government spending through his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).
He has instigated sweeping cuts to federal workforce, cancelled international aid programmes, and has voiced support for far-right politics.
That has prompted a backlash among Tesla owners.
""Tesla takedown"" protests have seen demonstrators gather outside dealerships, in Portland, Oregon, last week, and New York City earlier in March, with the aim of undermining the Tesla brand.
Organisers behind the protests said on social media that the demonstrations were peaceful, buta few have been destructivewith fires intentionally set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Colorado and Massachusetts last week.
Asked in front of the White House whether such protesters should be labelled ""domestic terrorists"", the president said ""I will do that"", a position later confirmed by a White House spokesperson.
""You do it to Tesla and you do it to any company, we're going to catch you and you're going to go through hell,"" Trump said.
On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump blamed Tesla's share price falls on ""radical left lunatics"", who he said were trying to ""illegally and collusively boycott"" the firm.
However, stock analysts said the main reason for the poor performance of the shares was fear about Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.
UBS warned that new Tesla deliveries could be much lower than expected this year.
Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said that although there was ""an element"" of Elon Musk's politics having a ""brand impact"", there were other reasons for the share price fall.
Ultimately the drop came down to ""hard numbers"", she said.
""When we look at new orders, for example in Europe and China, you can see that they've effectively halved over the last year,"" she said.
Sales in Europe have fallen sharply this year. Across the continent, they were down 45% in January compared to the same month in 2024, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).
There has also been a steep decline in China – a key market – and Australia.
Other experts have said Tesla is over-valued, so the fall is seen as a correction, while others have pointed to rising competition from some of China's electric vehicle companies.
Investors are ""certainly getting more worried about an economic slowdown too, so the richest-valued companies like Tesla have been hit hardest in recent days"", Ms James said.
There have also been concerns that Musk has not been focusing enough of his attention on his firms.
In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, he said he was combining the Doge role with running his businesses ""with great difficulty"".
Alongside Tesla, his businesses include Space X, which has experienced serious failures in the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket, and the social media network X,which suffered an outage on Monday.
Despite his supportive comments, President Trump's policies so far have been designed to limit electric car sales in the US, including revoking a 2021 order by former president Joe Biden that half of all car sales should be electric by 2030, and halting unspent government funds for charging stations.
Trump's tariffs could also hurt the manufacturer. Tesla chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said in January Tesla parts sourced from Canada and Mexico would be subject to the levies and that this could hit profitability.
Tesla's share price fall came against a broaderUS market slump on Mondayas investors, concerned about the economic effects of Trump tariffs and weakening confidence in the economy, sold shares.
Trump's own economic policies on tariffs are also making investors nervous, analysts said.

Is the US really heading into a recession?,"During his election campaign last year, Donald Trump promised Americans he would usher in a new era of prosperity.
Now two months into his presidency, he's painting a slightly different picture.
He has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a ""little disturbance"" before he can bring back wealth to the US.
Meanwhile, even as the latest figures indicate inflation is easing,analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies.
So is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world's largest economy?
In the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.
A chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising.
A JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was ""tilting away from growth"", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs.
The forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.
The market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.
He has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.
The latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however.
Prices were up 2.8% over the 12 months to February, down from 3% in January, the Labor Department said.
Still, Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismissthe market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success.
""There will always be changes and adjustments,"" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty.
The posture has increased investor worries about his plans.
Goldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as ""the key risk"" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had ""the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious"".
""If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,"" the firm's analysts warned.

For many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like.
Investors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.
Brian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool.
""But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,"" he said. ""And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.""
The US economy was already undergoing a slowdown, engineered in part by the central bank, which has kept interest rates higher to try to cool activity and stabilise prices.
In recent weeks, some data suggests a more rapid weakening.
Retail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump's election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback.
Some analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.
That could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation.

The head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.
""Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,"" he said.
But the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.
""The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway ... is really fuelling recession fears,"" she says.
The unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump.
Investors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).
Chipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.
That type of rise had stirred debate about an ""AI bubble"" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy.
Now, with views of the US economy darkening, optimism about AI is getting even harder to sustain.
Tech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had ""taken a step back"" as the chance of a recession increased ""measurably"" over the past month.
""The bottom line is that if we enter a recession, it will be extremely difficult for the AI trade to continue,"" he said.

Is Trump mulling a minerals deal with conflict-hit DR Congo?,"The Democratic Republic of Congo appears to be turning to the US in its latest efforts to find an ally in its fight against advancing M23 rebels.
Recognising that the White House of President Donald Trump is interested in transactional relationships - and seeing the proposed Ukraine-US mineral deal - the resource-rich DR Congo is hoping to strike its own agreement with Washington.
It has also been reported that Trump is soon to appoint the father-in-law of his daughter, Tiffany, to a key role in the region.
Congolese government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya confirmed to the BBC's Newsday programme that his country wanted to bring the US on board and supply it ""with some critical minerals"".
""Of course... we can also talk about security,"" he added.
DR Congo is in trouble militarily.
M23 fighters - backed by neighbouring Rwanda - have made major advances in parts of the mineral-rich east of the country.
Regional forces - first from east and then southern Africa - which were supposed to provide some help have failed to hold back the rebels. The M23 has talked about advancing west in a bid to seize the capital, Kinshasa, even though it is 1,600km (1,000 miles) away.
Given the dangers, it is not surprising that President Félix Tshisekedi might be looking at ways to shore up his position.
On 22 February,Tshisekedi was reported by the New York Timesto have said that the Trump administration had shown interest in a deal involving strategic minerals.
The day before, the Africa-USA Business Council - a lobby group - wrote to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on behalf of a Congolese senator describing a possible deal that included an ""economic and military partnership"".
DR Congo is estimated to have $24tn-worth (£19tn) of untapped resources - including cobalt, gold and copper.
The country is currently the world's largest supplier of cobalt - which has defence and aerospace applications as well as being essential for batteries in electric vehicles - but most of this goes to China. It also has significant lithium, tantalum and uranium deposits, which also have military uses.
Thoughthe US is investing in a huge infrastructure project- the Lobito corridor - designed to transport goods out of central Africa to a port in Angola, its companies are not involved in mining in DR Congo.
As China dominates the Congolese mineral sector, there could be ""a widening strategic gap, where adversarial nations continue to monopolise Africa's resources"", the letter to Rubio said.
In theory, DR Congo could offer favourable terms to US companies to exploit the resources.
But, according to mining analyst Gregory Mthembu-Salter, as the US, unlike China, relies on private commercial companies to do the work, they may decide that it is too risky to do business there.
But this is all highly speculative and a US Department of State spokesperson said that there was ""nothing to preview or announce at this time"".
Nevertheless, the US ""is open to discussing partnerships in this sector"" that align with the executive order aimed at making the US a ""leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals"".
One key area could be in ""strengthening military co-operation"", as the letter to Rubio puts it.
This would involve:
The Congolese spokesperson declined to confirm these details, but there is some scepticism about how realistic and immediately effective they could be.
According to Stephanie Wolters, regional analyst for the South African Institute of International Affairs, if Kinshasa wants a US military presence in the east then ""that is not very likely to happen"".
Furthermore, ""weapons and training are longer-term issues"", she told BBC Focus on Africa.
""I think the outreach the Congolese government has made is surely because of the active military situation in the east and I'm not convinced that what the US might offer in return is really something that can address the acute need at the moment.""
Congolese mining industry analyst Jean-Pierre Okenda said some oversight of the deal would be wise, suggesting parliament and civil society should also be consulted if it was going to serve the interests of the people.
Looking at the bigger picture, he said that moves towards a more peaceful future need to address the ""kleptocratic management of the state"".
A previous deal with China that gave access to minerals in exchange for infrastructure projects was criticised for not delivering on some of what was promised.
Tshisekedi has since renegotiated this, but the lack of transparency in those talks has been criticised.
Nothing concrete is likely to happen soon.
While Muyaya, speaking for Kinshasa, was vague on what we could expect, he told the BBC that ""in the coming days we can have more details to share"".
He added that there was ""the political will [from Tshisekedi] and I think the US has attention on those questions"".
On the US side,according to the news website Semafor, President Trump is due to announce that Massad Boulos will be the White House's new Great Lakes regional envoy.
He is the father of Michael Boulos, who is married to Trump's daughter Tiffany, and has been serving as Trump's senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs since December.
Among his business interests is a Nigeria-based company that specialises in the distribution of motor vehicles and equipment across West Africa - and he is expected to fly to Kinshasa at some point in the next few weeks.

What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?,"The US has introduced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports from around the world.
In response, the EU has said it will impose tariffs on US goods worth billions of dollars, stoking fears of a global trade war.
President Donald Trump Trump has already imposed 25% tariffs on other imports from Mexico and Canada - with some exemptions - and a 20% levy on Chinese goods.
But he chose not double the levy for Canadian metal imports, just hours after first threatening to do so.

Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.
The companies that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government.
Typically, tariffs are a percentage of a product's value. A 20% tariff on Chinese goods means a product worth $10 (£7.76) has an additional $2 charge.
Firms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers.
The US has typically charged lower tariffs on goods than other countries.
Trump's new tariffs - and his promise to introduce further ""reciprocal"" levies on goods from other countries - could lead to a sharp increase in the prices people pay for goods in the US and around the globe.
Tariffs are a central part of Trump's overall economic vision.
He says tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, raising tax revenue and growing the domestic economy.
He also wants to restore America's trade balance with its foreign partners - reducing the gap that exists between how much the US imports from and exports to individual countries.
But he has refused to rule out the prospect of a recession as a result of his trade policies, whichsent US stocks sharply down in the days before the metal tariffs took effect.
US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later said the tariffs were ""worth it"" even if they did lead to an economic downturn.
Trump's tariffs initially targeted goods from China, Mexico and Canada.
These accounted for more than 40% of imports into the US in 2024.
But Trump has accused the three countries of not doing enough to end the flow of migrants and illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the US.
All three countries have rejected the accusations.
Fentanyl is linked to tens of thousands of overdose deaths in the US each year.
Outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country was responsible for less than 1% of fentanyl entering the US,most of which comes from Mexico.
The 25% tariffs on all US imports of steel and aluminum began on 12 March.
The US buys more steel than any other country - with Canada, Brazil and Mexico its top three suppliers.
Canada is also the largest supplier of aluminum to the US, providing almost 60% of the amount imported.
When Trumpfirst announced the tariff on steel and aluminium imports, he said there would be no exceptions.
On 11 March, he threatened to double the levy for Canadian metals because of that country's decision to charge more to electricity customers in three northern US states, in response to other US tariffs.
Trumpscrapped this planjust hours before it was due to take effect, after Canada agreed to suspend the extra energy charges.
In the hours after the levy took effect, the EU announced retaliatory tariffs on US goods worth €26bn (£22bn).
These will start on 1 April and be fully in place on 13 April.They will cover items ranging ""from boats to bourbon to motorbikes"", in addition to steel and aluminium goods such as pipes, window frames and tin foil.
European Commision President Ursula von der Leyen said she ""deeply regrets this measure"". Tariffs are ""bad for business and worse for consumers"", she added.
China's foreign ministry said the country would take ""all necessary measures"" to safeguard its rights and interests, arguing that the tariffs breached World Trade Organization rules.
Canada's high commissioner to the UK criticised the ""lawless trade world of Donald Trump"". Ralph Goodale told the BBC that Canada would hit ""particularly sensitive"" US products in response.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the levies ""entirely unjustified"".
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmertold MPs that the UK will take ""pragmatic approach"" to the US tariffs, as part of wider discussions with the Trump administration.
""We are negotiating an economic deal which covers and will include tariffs if we succeed, but we will keep all options on the table.""
Trump previously announced tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium in 2018, during his first term as president.
However, he later negotiated exceptions for many countries including Australia, Canada and Mexico.
Despite those previous exemptions, tariffs raised the average price of steel and aluminium in the US by 2.4% and 1.6% respectively, according to the US International Trade Commission.
Trump has introduced 25% tariffs on other goods from both US neighbours, Canada and Mexico.
These were originally due to start on 4 February but were delayed for a month to allow further negotiations. The 25% tariffs began on 4 March, with a 10% tariff on Canadian energy imports.
On 5 March, Trump announced amonth-long tariff exemption for cars made in North Americawhich comply with the continent's existing free trade agreement,  the US-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA).
That deal, which was negotiated by Trump during his first term in office, sets out rules for how much of a car must be made in each country to qualify for duty-free treatment.
The Canadian and Mexican tariffs had prompted fears of significant impacts on car manufacturing.
Component parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.
Shares in leading US carmakers rose after the announcement.
On 6 March Trumpexpanded the tariff exemption to include other goods shipped under the USMCA.
Items currently covered by the pact's rules include televisions, air conditioners, avocados and beef, according to analysis by the firm Trade Partnership Worldwide.
Trump also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser used by US farmers - from 25% to 10%.
Outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeaucalled the tariffs ""very dumb"", and accused Trump of planning ""a total collapse of the Canadian economy [to] make it easier to annex us"".
He said Canada would immediately targetC$30bn ($21bn; £16bn) worth of US imports, and goods worth a further C$125bn in 21 days.
After Trump excluded more Canadian goods from the tariffs, Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc saidthe country would delay the second round of retaliatory taxes.
However, Trudeau told reporters that a trade war between the two allies remained likely for the foreseeable future.
His successor - the incoming Prime Minister Mark Carney - alsostrongly criticised Trump's ""unjustified tariffs"", and vowed that ""in trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.""
Ontario Premier Doug Ford had said he would bring in a25% surcharge on Canadian electricity exports to three US states: Michigan, New York and Minnesotain response to the tariffs.
But these plans were suspended after Trump's threat to double the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium imports.
Mexico also delayed retaliatory tariffs on US goods during the initial month-long pause.
President Claudia Sheinbaum urged Mexicans to ""remain calm"" over Trump, insisting that ""cooler heads will prevail.""
She also agreed to deploy 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border to help tackle smuggling.
Speaking after the tariffs came into force on 4 March, she said the US decision had ""no justification"", and promised to respond with ""tariff and non-tariff measures"".
However, before these were set out, Trump announced the concessions for carmakers and other goods, which she welcomed.
While Trump has been very critical of his Canadian counterpart Trudeau, he has praised Sheinbaum, calling their relationship ""very good"".
A 10% charge on all goods imported from Chinastarted on 4 February.
Trump later saidshipments worth less than $800 would be exempt.
On 10 February, Chinaresponded with its own tariffs, including a 10-15% tax on some US agricultural goods.
Beijing has also targeted various US aviation, defence and tech firms by adding them to an ""unreliable entity list"" and imposing export controls.
The 10% levy doubled to 20% on 4 March.
China urged the US to return to dialogue with Beijing as soon as possible.
""If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end,"" foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian warned.
All steel and aluminium imports are being taxed at 25%.
Goods from China worth more than $800 are covered by the 20% tariff.
Non-exempt imports from Mexican and Canada are subject to a 25% levy.
Canadian energy exports to the US face a 10% tariff, which could affect a broad range of businesses.

US tariffs on imported washing machines between 2018 and 2023 increased the price of laundry equipment by 34%, according to official statistics. Prices fell once the tariffs expired.
The US has not announced any targeted sanctions against the UK.
Britain exports pharmaceutical products, cars and scientific instruments to America.
Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds says the UK is negotiating a broader economic agreement with the US to get rid of tariffs, but no details of this have been announced.
During his 26 February cabinet meeting,Trump said he would announce specific sanctions on EU goods ""very soon"".
""It'll be 25% generally speaking and that will be on cars and all other things,"" he added.
The US had a trade deficit of $213bn with the EU in 2024 - something Trump has previously described as ""an atrocity"".
At the time, the European Commission said it would react ""firmly and immediately against unjustified tariffs"".
US companies Harley Davidson and Jack Daniel's have previously faced EU tariffs.

Trump halts plan for 50% steel and aluminium tariffs on Canada,"Donald Trump has halted a plan to double US tariffs on Canadian steel and metal imports to 50%, just hours after first threatening them.
Tariffs of 25% still went ahead and took effect on Wednesday.
The move by the president comes after the Canadian province of Ontario suspended new charges of 25% on electricity that it sends to some northern states in the US, hours after Trump threatened to sharply increase his tariffs on the country.
It marked the latest skirmish in a trade war that risks economic damage to the two North American neighbours.
""Cooler heads prevailed,"" Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro told broadcaster CNBC, confirming that Trump would not move forward with his latest tariff threats.
Canada, one of America's closest trade partners, has borne the brunt of Trump's ire as he has launched trade battles in his first months in office.
Trump has hit goods from the country, along with Mexico, with a blanket 25% tariff, though he signed orders temporarily exempting a significant number of items from the new duties, which he said were a response to drugs and migrants crossing into the US.
Canada is also facing 25% tariffs on its steel and aluminium, which are set to go into effect on Wednesday, after Trump said he was ending exemptions to the duties previously granted to some countries.
Canada has called Trump's attacks unjustified and announced retaliation, including new tariffs on C$30bn ($22bn; £16bn) of US products.
Ford had announced he would tax electricity exports to the US in an effort to get those tariffs removed.
He had also previously said he would ""not hesitate to shut off electricity completely"" if the US ""escalates"".
Announcing the decision to suspend the electricity duties, Ford said he thought it was the ""right decision"" to try to focus the discussions on the wider North American free trade deal.
""With any negotiation that we have, there's a point that both parties are heated and the temperature needs to come down,"" he said,  thanking Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for contacting him about a meeting.
""They understand how serious we are,"" he added. ""We have both agreed, let cooler heads prevail. We need to sit down and move this forward.""
In his social media post early on Tuesday, which threatened to double levies on Canadian steel and aluminium, Trump said he was responding to Ford's moves.
He also criticised Canada for relying on the US for ""military protection"", and reiterated that he wanted the country to become the 51st US state.
He added that it ""would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear"" if Canada were to join the US as a state.
The White House declared the episode a win, saying in a statement that Trump had ""once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world, to deliver a win for the American people"".
Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.
The companies that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government.
The back-and-forth came during a turbulent time for markets.
The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US fell a further 0.7% on Tuesday after dropping 2.7% on Monday, which was its biggest one-day drop since December.
The UK's FTSE 100 share index, which had edged lower earlier on Tuesday, fell further following Trump's latest comments and closed down more than 1%. The French Cac 40 index and German Dax followed a similar pattern.
Monday's stock market sell-off had begun after Trumpsaid the economy was in a ""transition""when asked about whether the US was heading for a recession.
Investors have been concerned about the economic effects of Trump's trade policies, which it is feared could push up inflation in the US and beyond, while uncertainty leads to economic paralyisis.
Even before Tuesday's comments, Trump's tariffs had already been causing concern for US businesses.
On Monday, Jason Goldstein, founder of Icarus Brewing, a small beer-maker in New Jersey that employs 50 people, told the BBC that previous tariff announcements had prompted a slew of emails from his suppliers.
They have been warning that price increases for everything from grain and aluminium cans are likely to be coming.
Mr Goldstein has stockpiled an extra month's supply of cans and held off on new purchases as a result of the uncertainty and rapidly changing situation.
""It's definitely a worrying time for us,"" he said.
""Never before in my life have I had to read so much news, watch so much news to know, here's what my industry's going to look like tomorrow.""

From chatbots to intelligent toys: How AI is booming in China,"Head in hands, eight-year-old Timmy muttered to himself as he tried to beat a robot powered by artificial intelligence at a game of chess.
But this was not an AI showroom or laboratory – this robot was living on a coffee table in a Beijing apartment, along with Timmy.
The first night it came home, Timmy hugged his little robot friend before heading to bed. He doesn't have a name for it – yet.
""It's like a little teacher or a little friend,"" the boy said, as he showed his mum the next move he was considering on the chess board.
Moments later, the robot chimed in: ""Congrats! You win."" Round eyes blinking on the screen, it began rearranging the pieces to start a new game as it continued in Mandarin: ""I've seen your ability, I will do better next time.""
China is embracing AI in its bid to become a tech superpower by 2030.
DeepSeek,the breakthrough Chinese chatbotthat caught the world's attention in January, was just the first hint of that ambition.
Money is pouring into AI businesses seeking more capital, fuelling domestic competition. There are more than 4,500 firms developing and selling AI, schools in the capital Beijing are introducing AI courses for primary and secondary students later this year, and universities have increased the number of places available for students studying AI.
""This is an inevitable trend. We will co-exist with AI,"" said Timmy's mum, Yan Xue. ""Children should get to know it as early as possible. We should not reject it.""
She is keen for her son to learn both chess and the strategy board game Go – the robot does both, which persuaded her that its $800 price tag was a good investment. Its creators are already planning to add a language tutoring programme.
Perhaps this was what the Chinese Communist Party hoped for when it declared in 2017 that AI would be ""the main driving force"" of the country's progress. President Xi Jinping is now betting big on it, as a slowing Chinese economy grapples with the blow of tariffs from its biggest trading partner, the United States.
Beijing plans to invest 10tn Chinese yuan ($1.4tn; £1tn) in the next 15 years as it competes with Washington to gain the edge in advanced tech. AI funding got yet another boost at the government's annual political gathering, which is currently under way. This comes on the heels of a 60 billion yuan-AI investment fund created in January, just days after the US further tightened export controls for advanced chips and placed more Chinese firms on a trade blacklist.
But DeepSeek has shown that Chinese companies can overcome these barriers. And that's what has stunned Silicon Valley and industry experts – they did not expect China to catch up so soon.
It's a reaction Tommy Tang has become accustomed to after six months of marketing his firm's chess-playing robot at various competitions.
Timmy's machine comes from the same company, SenseRobot, which offers a wide range in abilities – Chinese state media hailed an advanced version in 2022 that beat chess Grand Masters at the game.
""Parents will ask about the price, then they will ask where I am from. They expect me to come from the US or Europe. They seem surprised that I am from China,"" Mr Tang said, smiling. ""There will always be one or two seconds of silence when I say I am from China.""
His firm has sold more than 100,000 of the robots and now has a contract with a major US supermarket chain, Costco.
One of the secrets to China's engineering success is its young people. In 2020, more than 3.5 million of the country's students graduated with degrees in science, technology, engineering and maths, better known as STEM.
That's more than any other country in the world - and Beijing is keen to leverage it. ""Building strength in education, science and talent is a shared responsibility,"" Xi told party leaders last week.
Ever since China opened its economy to the world in the late 1970s, it has ""been through a process of accumulating talent and technology,"" says Abbott Lyu, vice-president of Shanghai-based Whalesbot, a firm that makes AI toys. ""In this era of AI, we've got many, many engineers, and they are hardworking.""
Behind him, a dinosaur made of variously coloured bricks roars to life. It's being controlled through code assembled on a smartphone by a seven-year-old.
The company is developing toys to help children as young as three learn code. Every package of bricks comes with a booklet of code. Children can then choose what they want to build and learn how to do it. The cheapest toy sells for around $40.
""Other countries have AI education robots as well, but when it comes to competitiveness and smart hardware, China is doing better,"" Mr Lyu insists.
The success of DeepSeek turned its CEO Liang Wenfeng into a national hero and ""is worth 10 billion yuan of advertising for [China's] AI industry,"" he added.
""It has let the public know that AI is not just a concept, that it can indeed change people's lives. It has inspired public curiosity.""
Six homegrown AI firms, including DeepSeek, have now been nicknamed China's six little dragons by the internet – the others are Unitree Robotics, Deep Robotics, BrainCo, Game Science, and Manycore Tech.
Some of them were at a recent AI fair in Shanghai, where the biggest Chinese firms in the business showed off their advances, from search and rescue robots to a backflipping dog-like one, which wandered the halls among visitors.
In one bustling exhibition hall, two teams of humanoid robots battled it out in a game of football, complete in red and blue jerseys. The machines fell when they clashed – and one of them was even taken off the field in a stretcher by their human handler who was keen to keep the joke going.
It was hard to miss the air of excitement among developers in the wake of DeepSeek. ""Deepseek means the world knows we are here,"" said Yu Jingji, a 26-year-old engineer.
But as the world learns of China's AI potential, there are also concerns about what AI is allowing the Chinese government to learn about its users.
AI is hungry for data - the more it gets, the smarter it makes itself and, with around a billion mobile phone users compared to just over 400 million in the US, Beijing has a real advantage.
The West, its allies and many experts in these countries believe that data gathered by Chinese apps such as DeepSeek, RedNote or TikTok can be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party. Some point to the country's National Intelligence Law as evidence of this.
But Chinese firms, including ByteDance, which owns TikTok, says the law allows for the protection of private companies and personal data. Still, suspicion that US user data on TikTok could end up in the hands of the Chinese government droveWashington's decision to ban the hugely popular app.
That same fear – where privacy concerns meet national security challenges - is hitting Deepseek. South Korea bannednew downloads of DeepSeek, while Taiwan and Australia havebarred the app from government-issued devices.
Chinese companies are aware of these sensitivities and Mr Tang was quick to tell the BBC that ""privacy was a red line"" for his company. Beijing also realises that this will be a challenge in its bid to be a global leader in AI.
""DeepSeek's rapid rise has triggered hostile reactions from some in the West,"" a commentary in the state-run Beijing Daily noted, adding that ""the development environment for China's AI models remains highly uncertain"".
But China's AI firms are not deterred. Rather, they believe thrifty innovation will win them an undeniable advantage – because it was DeepSeek's claim that it could rival ChatGPT for a fraction of the cost that shocked the AI industry.
So the engineering challenge is how to make more, for less. ""This was our Mission Impossible,"" Mr Tang said. His company found that the robotic arm used to move chess pieces was hugely expensive to produce and would drive the price up to around $40,000.
So, they tried using AI to help do the work of engineers and enhance the manufacturing process. Mr Tang claims that has driven the cost down to $1,000.
""This is innovation,"" he says. ""Artificial engineering is now integrated into the manufacturing process.""
This could have enormous implications as China applies AI on a vast scale. State media already show factories full of humanoid robots. In January, the government said that it would promote the development of AI-powered humanoid robots to help look after its rapidly ageing population.
Xi has repeatedly declared ""technological self-reliance"" a key goal, which means China wants to create its own advanced chips, to make up for US export restrictions that could hinder its plans.
The Chinese leader knows he is in for a long race – the Beijing Daily recently warned that the DeepSeek moment was not a time for ""AI triumphalism"" because China was still in ""catch-up mode"".
President Xi is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, robots and advanced tech in preparation for a marathon that he hopes China will eventually win.

Google Chromecast users' fury at second day of TV streaming issue,"Google says it is working to fix an issue which has left many Chromecast users unable to watch content on their televisions for a second day.
The tech giant says it has sold more than 100m of these devices worldwide across various generations, with the issues specifically impacting the ""second generation"" model.
Owners of these Chromecasts have been unable to connect them to their televisions - meaning they cannot use streaming services like Netflix and YouTube on the big screen - with Chromecast Audio devices also facing issues.
And the company has warned users not to try to fix the problem themselves by performing a factory reset to affected devicesin a post on the Google Nest support forum.
""Do not factory reset your device - we will keep you all updated when the fix rolls out,"" it says.
""If you have already factory reset your device, we will provide instructions to set your device back up as soon as possible.""
But several social media users suggested Google's advice had come too late for some who had already reset their affected Chromecasts.
""Factory reset is literally the first thing I did when my Chromecast stopped working,"" wrote a user replying to Google on X.
""Google asking everyone to please not factory reset their Chromecast after hours when it's one of the most used fixes, is hilarious,""said another.
Google's Chromecast devices plug into TVs and allow users to stream content like web video and music wirelessly using a mobile device or laptop.
It also provides the ability to display anything from inside a tab on its Chrome web browser.
Customers first began to report issues affecting some Chromecasts and their ability to ""cast"" streaming content from devices to TVs on Sunday evening.
Users trying to stream content were met with alerts which said the device could not be authenticated, its connection had failed, or the Chromecast itself was ""untrusted"".
Googlesaid in August 2024it would be discontinuing Chromecast, replacing its 11-year-old device with a new Google TV system, but it promised to support existing devices with updates.
According to a report by The Register,the issue may have been caused by an expired authentication certificate.
The BBC has asked Google to confirm if this is indeed the case.

Global smartwatch sales fall for first time,"Global sales of smartwatches have fallen for the first time, new figures indicate, in large part due to a sharp decline in the popularity of market leader, Apple.
Market research firm Counterpoint says 7% fewer of the devices were shipped in 2024 compared to the year before.
Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.
It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.
""The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,"" saidCounterpointsenior research analyst Anshika Jain.
Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over adisputed patentregarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.
It retained 22% of market share in the final three months of 2024, down from 25% a year earlier.
""We've been through a period where the smartwatch has gone from being a new and exciting gadget, to something now that's stabilising - the feature set isn't changing very dramatically year over year,"" said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight.
Despite the overall decline, last year did see a massive rise in sales for Chinese-made smartwatches from brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei and Imoo.
Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.
This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.
The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.
Imoo, known in China as ""Little Genius"", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.
""The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,"" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.
But Imoo was eclipsed by a 135% rise in shipments from Beijing-based tech company Xiaomi.
Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.
""We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,"" said Mr Gebbie.
""Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.""
Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.
He said this was partly because of a ""bubble"" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.
""We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,"" he said.
""For those companies, there's been a sense that from this point onwards they would be better served by maybe making and selling products with a slightly longer lifespan.""
Counterpoint says it expects a small recovery in the global market, with ""single-digit percentage growth in 2025"".
It predicts the uptick in sales will be driven by the increasing adoption of AI features, and a greater emphasis of providing a wider range of health data.
"
Trump is no longer swayed by the stock markets,"On the day of the US presidential inauguration I was told by a top US tech chief executive that although he was likely to be hit by retaliatory tariffs, he assumed any trade war would die down.
""Trump lives by the Dow Jones' reaction,"" he said - something markets call the ""Trump put"".
This means that whenever a White House announcement that damaged sentiment came out, the president would row back after seeing a stock market fall.
Those assumptions have now changed, after the president gave a TV interview in which he downplayed how much he was moved by markets.
And only a day after US stock markets fell sharply on worries over the impact of Trump's policies,the president has decided to double tariffs against Canadaon steel and aluminium, in response to higher charges for Canadian electricity, worth about $100 per bill, in New York, Minnesota and Michigan.
On Monday,Ontario premier Doug Ford announced a 25% surcharge on US-bound electricityand threatened to ""shut off"" supply completely.
President Trump has said he is rebuilding wealth based on decades or even a century into the future, and this cannot be measured in the quarterly results of America's stock market giants.
Alongside comments from his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the White House was communicating to markets that the president now has some tolerance for short-term market and economic pain. This has changed the calculus.
There are another two factors at play here. There is evidence of actual potential reversal in the US economic sentiment, raising questions about a recession.
The very latest real-time analysis by the Atlanta branch of the US Federal Reserve predicts a falling US economy in the first three months of the year.
Government cuts could also contribute to such a reading, but private sector sentiment has taken a hit too, especially by the hokey cokey over tariffs.
Above all, the uncertainty threatens to be crippling. The policies change by the day, and even then can get retrospectively paused.
Key US government departments are not entirely clear on the direction of travel in the White House.
On top of all of this, in the case of Canada, a likely election suggests little incentive to compromise.
Indeed, what is there to compromise with when Trump says he wants to use economic leverage to make his northern neighbour his ""51st State""?
The direction of travel here is for the trade war to escalate in intensity and scope.
New trade barriers on the European Union may emerge in three weeks' time based on ""reciprocity"".
As other nations see signs of inflation re-emerging in the US, they will be more likely to try to add to it, to bring home to US consumers the consequences of the decisions of their government.
In the past fortnight the world has learnt that President Trump is serious about tariffs, even on his allies. They have been applied in a huge way.
Key trade partners have reciprocated in kind and have an incentive to up the ante. And the White House now wants to communicate it has a high pain threshold for short-term economic and market disruption.
All roads lead to 2 April and the announcement on ""reciprocal tariffs"", and for now these tensions do not appear to be heading for a truce, ceasefire or pause.

Why people are cutting back their online profile,"Anita Smith has always been cautious about how much she shared online.
But her concerns increased following an abusive relationship with a partner, who later stalked her.
Although police intervened, she left the UK and also scaled back her online profile.
""I erased my online presence as much as I possibly could, including removing the locations of some posts, and a couple of Instagram accounts,"" says Ms Smith, whose name has been changed for this article.
Ms Smith, who works in communications, still has a LinkedIn account but doesn't use her full name.
""I deleted quite a few things off my LinkedIn too, lots of things that were location based, although a few posts do remain.
""I have posted recently as I'm trying to build a brand although I'm sceptical as to how much I share.""
She has kept an original private Facebook account: ""I cleanse it once a year, and check on photos and privacy of posts and where I have been tagged.""
Ms Smith has also become more aware of the terms and conditions of social media platforms.
""I follow AI trends and I know a lot of images are training AI models and we don't have ethical guidelines on how they can be used. That's another massive factor why I will never put my child on social media as the images can be used for whatever want.""
As scams become more sophisticated, research suggests that more people are concerned about the information they share online.
In a report by Statista, 39% of respondents said they were worried about how companies use their online data, while a quarter (26%) admitted to using a VPN.
There are a number of reasons why people might want to reduce their online profiles.
""First of all, people underappreciate privacy,"" says Vytautas Kaziukonis, chief executive at Surfshark, a security software company that encrypts user's online data and aims to make browsing secure.
""What might be innocent information right now might be bring you into difficulties 10 years down the line, for example, if there's a change of laws, or political environment.""
Another issue is the explosion of AI, says Mr Kaziukonis.
""Fraud is getting better and better, and one thing that is essential for all scams is having data,"" he says.
AI is getting to the stage where it can impersonate people close to you. Add to that ability any personal information shared online, then you have a ""deadly combination"", says Mr Kaziukonis.
Also, information shared online about us is collected by data brokers and sold to advertisers.
Mr Kaziukonis says the information is also available to scammers. ""It's the Wild West out there,"" he says.
So what can we do to minimise our footprints?
Firstly, it's important to think about how much information you share online.
""Don't share your home address anywhere, for example, accidently filming a video with a laptop in the background that has sensitive information on, and when you go online shopping don't add all details to every random website, for example, your date of birth,"" says Mr Kaziukonis.
""It could be leaked and used against you."" He also advises using a different email address for websites that you sign up to. ""That limits the spamming.""
It's worth remembering that under data protection law, you have the right to ask a company what data they hold on you, and request that it is deleted.
""They have to comply as otherwise they can receive huge fines,"" says Mr Kaziukonis.
Gus Hosein, executive director at charity Privacy International, recommends several ways to reduce your digital footprint.
He suggests using a VPN (virtual private network) which, for a price, offers a user more privacy when online.
He also recommends cookie-blockers and selecting web browsers with privacy controls.
""The underlying solution remains that we must keep the pressure on our governments to have strong laws to protect everyone,"" Mr Hosein says.
Karen Renaud is a computing scientist at the University of Strathclyde  working on security and privacy.
Last year she studied 15 privacy policy documents, which lay out what a company is going to do with your data.
She found that the most complicated of them would take 32 minutes to read and would require college-level education to understand.
""The situation is pretty dire,"" she says.
She advises it's a good idea to clear out the cookies on your browser from time to time, and reduce the cookies you accept.
""Also, you can stop some tracking. Google, for example, makes it possible to prevent tracking of your searches.""
Some people turn to services such as DeleteMe and Surfshark, which help remove personal information from data brokers.
Amanda Unterreiner, product manager at US-based data removal service DeleteMe, says high-profile individuals like video gamers and judges use their service as a safety measure.
""In the case of judges… because if they're announcing some decision, someone might show up at their house.""
She also mentions the case ofthe killing earlier last yearof United Healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson.
""Stories like that kind of spark regular people to think I better get protected.""
Ms Unterreiner went through the process of having her data removed when she joined the company.
""You could see every other place I had ever lived, every phone number I've ever had, every email address, on the first page of Google. If someone wanted to steal my identity… they would be able to cause some real personal damage.""
The company also offers a service to mask your house on Google Maps.
""You can look at street view, but that particular property will just be kind of very pixelated.""
There's multiple reasons why Saam Collingwood, who lives near Stratford-upon-Avon, has cut back her online profile over the years.
The first was following an incident at work where she had included her personal Facebook account on an email to a client and her employer was unhappy.
""They were able to see photos from a night out,"" she says. ""That didn't go down too well.""
In another incident she was trolled by a stranger online after posting a video of herself learning a dance routine on YouTube.
Plus, rising online fraud convinced her to further reduce her online profile.
She hasn't completely erased her online presence but she no longer posts regularly on Facebook, reducing it about twice a year.
""I don't like it when people tag me, people knowing I'm not at home. Most times I remove the tag.""
She says she has upgraded her anti-virus and security software with a service from online security firm Norton.
""I wanted to make sure websites weren't taking my details. It makes me more comfortable.""
But are there any downsides to not being so present online?
""I miss seeing old friends [on Facebook] and people I would contact once or twice year,"" says Ms Smith.
Mr Kaziukonis says it's common to hear people say they don't care about privacy but he believes this is a flawed argument.
""They say I have nothing to hide. But would they mind sharing every single email they have sent? We have curtains at home, we want to feel private. It's human nature.""

'Crazy growth': How one product created a multi-million dollar brand,"Nell Diamond, CEO of Hill House, shares how her small business skyrocketed to global success with a simple, singular product.
At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hill House Home's Nap Dress became more than just a piece of clothing – it was a symbol of comfort and versatility for a world in flux. What started as a direct-to-consumer bedding and home business in 2016 had grown into a fashion movement, reflecting how a single dress could adapt to your body over the years and transform depending on the demands of the day.
The company introduced the Nap Dress in 2019, a design that leaned into the idea of smocked fabric from the 1950s and reimagined it with modern, universal appeal. It didn't take long for the dress – now with over 50 designs – to go viral on social media and become common in many closets around the world.
""Our crazy growth happened from 2019 to 2020 – right in the middle of quarantine and while I was pregnant with twins,"" CEO Nell Diamond tells the BBC. ""I could obviously see how much the business was changing internally from the sales volume, but one really pivotal moment for me was working from home, sitting in my bedroom in New York City, and looking out the window to see someone walking down the street wearing one of our dresses.
""Entrepreneurship can feel really lonely and insular, so to realise that people know about your little project is incredibly rewarding. I'll never forget that moment.""
Since then, the company has sold over one million Nap Dresses, expanded into categories like outerwear and swimwear, and opened five retail locations across the United States, from New York to Charleston. The brand's reach has also expanded within other retailers, including Shopbop and Saks. Hill House puts its current valuation at approximately $150m (£118m), although the BBC was unable to obtain an independent valuation.
The company has faced challenges, too, including navigating global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and scaling operations to meet increased demand. But at a time when small businesses struggle to stand out amid economic uncertainty, Hill House's story underscores the importance of adaptability and building strong connections with consumers.
""We've had the biggest year in company history,"" Diamond said. ""The business has continued to grow past even our optimistic plans.""
Diamond's love of fashion started early, during her teenage years while attending the American School in London, UK. After graduating from Princeton University, she joined the trading desk of a finance firm, initially entering the same sector of business as her father Bob Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays bank. She quickly realised, however, that her passion lay elsewhere.
""I was always drawn to retail,"" she says. ""I'd steal my friends' equity research papers to learn what companies were doing in the retail space. I realised that this thing which started as a guilty pleasure – loving fashion – turned out to be a viable career opportunity.""
Now, as CEO, Diamond oversees every aspect of the business, from growth strategy to creative direction. Below, she talks with the BBC about the company's biggest challenges, its rapid evolution into a lifestyle brand and plans for the future.
Hill House dates back to a startup incubator you joined while in business school at Yale University. How did you turn the idea into a fully fledged business?
I wanted to bring a design-forward point of view to the home category. We started with just home products: bedding, pillows, a little bit of pyjamas and robes. But I really focused on the home and, in particular, the bedroom, drawing off of some of the design elements of my London upbringing – great British brands like [interior decorating firm] Colfax and Fowler and amazing prints that I had seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum.
There were many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [approaches] and talking about cutting out the middleman. I wanted to do the same thing and … start small and focus on just one or two products. While I was at business school, I spent time on the little parts of starting a business – trademarks, legal documents, hiring my first few contractors and setting up our Instagram account. After graduating, I spent the first couple of years bootstrapping the business and really focusing on meeting our customers. It was a very small team in a co-working space in New York City.
By 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went from low and slow and careful growth to the success of the Nap Dress. Within a few months, our business was majority a fashion business based off the strength of this one product line. We went from five people to 30 people and from one store to now having almost six stores. It really changed the scale of the business. I remember our very first order was for a hundred units and being petrified that we wouldn't actually sell them. To have sold a million of them now is really crazy.
Why do you think this one particular product, the Nap Dress, resonates with so many people?
It's so many different things. We didn't invent smocking, which is what makes our dresses most identifiable. My grandmother was wearing smock dresses in the 1950s. Juicy Couture [the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking and terry cloth in the 2000s. But I think what was so important to us was figuring out a very proprietary type of smocking that could stretch with you. I wore it all throughout my twin pregnancy and then the snap back. It works with your changing body and throughout the day – it feels comfortable but you still look kind of put together.
When we first launched the Nap Dress, we would have somebody email in and say: ""Oh, my friend was wearing this dress at a dinner party, or at work or at preschool pickup, and I have to have it."" It was exacerbated by social media, but organic social media, which is the important distinction there. Even today, 30% of orders on our site come from word-of-mouth referrals.
What are some challenges you faced in the early days that you had to overcome?
There were – and continues to be – challenges every day. Early on and certainly during Covid, there were constant disruptions in the global supply chain, whether it was that one factory had to shut down or another one had delayed shipping.
In 2021, we expected we'd be able to have all the products here by a certain date for a product drop. There were crazydelays at portsall over due to shipping freight issues. That can affect your entire summer selling, your entire quarter of selling. In this increasingly online, seamless-delivery Amazon-dominated world, it is easy to forget how many human touch points there are and how fragile they can be. We internally would get so anxious and nervous any time one of those human touch points had a blockage.
But when we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying. I think it made it feel more personal to them. And that might be one of the many reasons why we have such a loyal customer base – we let them into that side of the business. It's clear that it's not so robotic and transactional.
How do you check that manufacturing partners and suppliers are abiding by the highest standards?
We have manufacturers in 12 countries across nearly all continents. It's all about tracking at every stage of the development process. We take that very seriously. We work with an organisation called Transparency One that helps us track across our supply chain at every stage and audit what our manufacturers are reporting. We've had many of the same manufacturers since day one and developed those human relationships with the people who make our clothes. One of our main manufacturers is the same person who we sent those first hundred unit orders to, and they should feel a tremendous amount of ownership over the growth that we've seen over the past couple years.
You've publicly said before that the business is very reliant on global trading routes and global supply chains. Now given that President-elect Trump hascampaigned on raising tariffs for imports, are you concerned about how this might affect costs and global trade more generally?
I can only speak for our own company, but I think that tariffs are certainly something we are thinking about.
How have you been expanding the brand?
We have a concept called Nells at our store in Charleston, South Carolina, inspired by my British upbringing. It's a pick-and-mix candy station, and there's a coffee and fountain soda bar, a nod to the Americana roots of the brand as well. It's never been easier to shop online, so if you're asking customers to come into your store, you should be delivering an experience that makes it worth it.
The home category is still really big for us now. But it just seems small in comparison to how all the fashion is doing. A new category we recently launched is swim – and that's performing really well. We asked what else our customers wanted to see from Hill House, and swim was an early answer.
The fashion world can be notoriously fickle. How can you ensure your products remain relevant across changes in fashion on the street?
We focus on our core customer, so I'm not so worried about what's relevant for anyone except for them. It can be easy in fashion to get caught up in a trend cycle, but our core customer is really focused on cute clothes that make them feel great and carry them through all of their different things that they have to do that day. Within that formula, we can deliver a product that makes them happy and not be so focused on a constant cycle of newness. It's about building pieces that last in their wardrobe.
What advice do you have for smaller businesses hoping to expand and build?
One of the most important pieces of advice I got when I was first starting out was to keep your blinders on. I remember constantly playing the comparison game in the early days and looking at other brands, Instagrams or advertisements or stores, thinking: ""We should have done that and we should have done this, and why can't we do that?"" That was never productive for me.
I had a real unlock when I started to tune out some of that noise and focus on what we have going on internally and how to make that as good as it possibly could be and can be. I mute a lot of people on Instagram if I'm getting a negative feeling from it. I always talk about putting the mute button on in real life, too, if something's not serving you in that way.
More like this:
•The 'missing middle' of small businesses
•Meet the founder of the slogan-jumper brand celebrities love
•Why TikTok creators are so good at getting people to buy things
Where do you see Hill House in the next few years? Do you think the Nap Dress will always be the centerpiece of the business?
My perception is that the Nap Dress will always be a hero product for us. But the growth right now is coming out of these new products, categories and from the retail channel. It's really exciting because I think that our customers have given us permission to go into not only these other rooms of their home but other activities they're doing with swim and outerwear.
I'm also incredibly bullish on retail. I would love to open more stores. We're very much a one-year-at-a-time brand, so I'd like to start with a couple more. But because we are very customer led, I'll let them tell us [what's next].

European stocks steady after US markets plunge,"A sell-off in global shares eased in Europe on Tuesday following a sharp fall in US stocks that came as investors raised concerns about the negative economic impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs.
It followed the president saying in a TV interview that the world's biggest economy was in a ""period of transition"", when asked about suggestions of a potential recession.
Since those remarks were broadcast on Sunday, top Trump officials and advisers have sought to calm investor fears.
The US S&P 500 share index fell nearly 3% on Monday, but in Europe most of the major markets opened little changed.
In a Fox News interview broadcast at the weekend but recorded on Thursday, Trump appeared to acknowledge concerns about the economy.
""I hate to predict things like that,"" he said. ""There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing.""
Charu Chanana, an investment strategist at investment bank Saxo, told the BBC:  ""The previous notion of Trump being a stock market president is being re-evaluated.""
On Monday in New York, the S&P 500, which tracks the biggest companies listed in the US, ended the trading day 2.7% lower, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2%.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq share index was hit particularly hard, sinking 4%.
Tesla shares fell by 15.4%, while artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant Nvidia was down more than 5%. Other major tech stocks including Meta, Amazon and Alphabet also fell sharply.
On Tuesday, Asian stocks fell sharply at first before recovering. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down 0.6% and South Korea's Kospi ended 1.3% lower.
The dollar slid further against the pound and the euro on Tuesday, having fallen sharply since the beginning of the month.
However, there was little sign of the turbulence spilling into Europe. While the FTSE 100 index, which tracks the biggest companies listed in the UK, dipped 0.1%, Germany's Dax index rose 0.4% and the French Cac 40 climbed 0.2%.
""Trump is keeping political leaders guessing regarding his next moves on tariffs, but the problem is that he's also keeping investors guessing and that's reflected in the dire market mood,"" said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at financial services firm KCM Trade.
""Whilst recession talk may be premature, the mere prospect of this coming to fruition is enough to put traders into a defensive mindset.""
Ruth Foxe-Blader of Foxe Capital told the BBC's Today programme that Monday had been a ""very difficult and chaotic day for the stock market in the US"" and ""the markets hate chaos"".
She said investors were reacting to Trump's policies - but also selling tech stocks they felt were overvalued.
Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said the drop in Tesla share price ""comes down to hard numbers"" with new orders halving in Europe and China over the past year.
She added there was ""an element"" of Elon Musk's politics ""having a brand impact"", but ""there's other angles"" including competition from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers and investors ""getting more worried about an economic slowdown"".
After trading closed on Monday, a White House official told reporters: ""We're seeing a strong divergence between [the] animal spirits of the stock market and what we're actually seeing unfold from businesses and business leaders.""
They added: ""The latter is obviously more meaningful than the former on what's in store for the economy in the medium to long term.""
In a separate statement later in the day, White House spokesman Kush Desai said ""industry leaders"" had responded to Trump's agenda, including tariffs, ""with trillions in investment commitments"".
Last week, the main US markets fell back to the level seen before Trump's election victory last November, which had initially been welcomed by investors due to hopes of tax cuts and lighter regulation.
Investors fear Trump's tariffs - which are taxes on goods applied as they enter the country - will lead to higher prices and dent growth in the world's largest economy.
The president introduced the measures after accusing China, Mexico and Canada of not doing enough to end the flow of illegal drugs and migrants into the US. The three countries have rejected the accusations.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian said investors were initially optimistic about Trump's plans for de-regulation and lower taxes, while under-estimating the likelihood of a trade war.
He said the recent falls in the stock market, which started last week, reflect the adjustment of those bets.
""It's a complete change in what the market expected,"" he added, noting that investors are also responding to signs that businesses and households are starting to hold off on spending due to uncertainty, which could hurt economic growth.
But Kevin Hassett, an economic adviser to President Trump, has pushed back against those projecting this bleak outlook.
In an interview with CNBC, Hassett said there were many reasons to be optimistic about the US economy and that that tariffs imposed on Canada, Mexico and China were already bringing manufacturing and jobs to the United States.
""There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward,"" he said.
He admitted there were some ""blips in the data"" for this quarter, which he pinned on the timing of Trump's tariffs and the ""Biden inheritance"".

"Facebook was 'hand in glove' with China, BBC told","A former senior Facebook executive has told the BBC how the social media giant worked ""hand in glove"" with the Chinese government on potential ways of allowing Beijing to censor and control content in China.
Sarah Wynn-Williams - a former global public policy director - says in return for gaining access to the Chinese market of hundreds of millions of users, Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, considered agreeing to hiding posts that were going viral, until they could be checked by the Chinese authorities.
Ms Williams - who makes the claims in a new book - has also filed a whistleblower complaint with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging Meta misled investors. The BBC has reviewed the complaint.
Facebook's parent company Meta, says Ms Wynn-Williams had her employment terminated in 2017 ""for poor performance"".
It is ""no secret we were once interested"" in operating services in China, it adds. ""We ultimately opted not to go through with the ideas we'd explored.""
Meta referred us to Mark Zuckerberg's comments from 2019, when he said: ""We could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they [China] never let us in.""
Facebook also used algorithms to spot when young teenagers were feeling vulnerable as part of research aimed at advertisers, Ms Wynn-Williams alleges.
A former New Zealand diplomat, she joined Facebook in 2011, and says she watched the company grow from ""a front row seat"".
Now she wants to show some of the ""decision-making and moral compromises"" that she says went on when she was there. It is a critical moment, she adds, as ""many of the people I worked with… are going to be central"" to the introduction of AI.
In her memoir, Careless People, Ms Wynn-Williams paints a picture of what she alleges working on Facebook's senior team was like.
Mr Zuckerberg, she says, did not get up before midday, loved karaoke and did not like to be beaten at board games, such as Risk. ""I didn't realise that you were supposed to let him win. I was a little naive,"" she told us.
However, Ms Wynn-Williams says her allegations about the company's close relationship with China provide an insight into Facebook's decision-making at the time.
""China is Mark Zuckerberg's white whale,"" meaning a goal that he obsessively pursued, says Ms Wynn-Williams.
The country is the world's biggest social media market, but access to Facebook remains blocked there, alongside the likes of X and YouTube.
""It's the one piece on the board game that he hasn't conquered,"" she says.
Ms Wynn-Williams claims that in the mid-2010s, as part of its negotiations with the Chinese government, Facebook considered allowing it future access to Chinese citizens' user data.
""He was working hand in glove with the Chinese Communist Party, building a censorship tool… basically working to develop sort of the antithesis of many of the principles that underpin Facebook,"" she told the BBC.
Ms Wynn-Williams says governments frequently asked for explanations of how aspects of Facebook's software worked, but were told it was proprietary information.
""But when it came to the Chinese, the curtain was pulled back,"" she says.
""Engineers were brought out. They were walked through every aspect, and Facebook was making sure these Chinese officials were upskilled enough that they could not only learn about these products, but then test Facebook on the censorship version of these products that they were building.""
Meta told the BBC that such claims about China had been ""widely reported"" at the time.
In her SEC complaint, Ms Wynn-Williams also alleges Mr Zuckerberg and other Meta executives had made ""misleading statements… in response to Congressional inquiries"" about China.
One answer given by Mr Zuckerberg to Congress in 2018 said Facebook was ""not in a position to know exactly how the [Chinese] government would seek to apply its laws and regulations on content""
Meta told the BBC that Mr Zuckerberg gave accurate testimony, adding it did not operate services in China.
Most Facebook executives didn't allow their own children on Facebook - according to Ms Wynn-Williams. ""They had screen bans. They certainly wouldn't allow them to use the product.""
And yet she saysreports from 2017- that the company had been using algorithms to target and categorise vulnerable teens - were true.
""The algorithm could infer that they were feeling worthless or unhappy,"" she alleges.
The company - which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp - could, she claims, identify when a teenage girl had deleted a selfie on its platforms, and then notify a beauty company that it would be a good moment to target the child with an advert.
Ms Wynn-Williams says she ""felt sick"" at the thought and tried to push back, ""although I knew it was futile"".
""They said: 'The business side thinks this is exactly what we should be doing. We've got this amazing product, we can get young people, which is a really important advertising segment.'""
Meta told the BBC this was false - it has never offered tools to target people based on their emotional state - and that the research it previously did was to help marketers understand how people express themselves on Facebook, not to target ads.
Overall, Ms Wynn-Williams says the company has not done enough to address the issue of young people's safety on social media.
""This is one of the most valuable companies in the world. They could invest in this and make it a real priority and do more to fix it.""
Facebook said it was transparent about advert-targeting andhad shared updates regarding its approachto creating age-appropriate advert experiences for teens.
It also said it had introduced ""Teen Accounts"" for tens of millions of young people with built-in protections. It also said it was giving parents more oversight over their teens' use of the app.
As well as poor performance, Meta says the 45-year-old was also fired for ""toxic behaviour"" after she had made ""misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment"".
But Ms Wynn-Williams told the BBC she was let go after she had complained about inappropriate comments by one of her bosses - Joel Kaplan, who is now Meta's chief global affairs officer.
Meta told us she had been paid by ""anti-Facebook activists"" and she was not a whistleblower.
""Whistleblower status protects communications to the government, not disgruntled activists trying to sell books,"" it said.
In regard to Ms Wynn-Williams' book, Meta has confirmed to the BBC that it has launched legal action in the US to ""halt the further distribution of defamatory and untrue information"".
To counter this, a legal representative for Ms Wynn-Williams said: ""Meta has made a number of false and inconsistent statements about Sarah since the news of her memoir broke... while Meta's statements are trying to mislead the public, the book speaks for itself"".
We asked her why she was speaking out now. She said she wanted Meta to change as it ""influences so much of our day-to-day life"" and we need to ensure ""we get the future we deserve"".
""We're in this moment where tech and political leaders are coming together and as they combine forces, that has a lot of consequences for all of us.
""I think it's really important to understand that and to understand you look at all these engineers who are influencing the highest level of government.""

Starmer says benefit system unfair and indefensible,"Sir Keir Starmer has called the current benefits system unsustainable, indefensible and unfair, and said the government could not ""shrug its shoulders and look away"".
Addressing Labour MPs on Monday evening, the prime minister said the current welfare system was ""the worst of all worlds"", discouraging people from working while producing a ""spiralling bill"".
The comments come as Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall prepares to set out changes to the welfare system and cut the benefits bill in the coming weeks.
Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarkedseveral billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement.
Changes likely to be announced in the coming days include restrictions on eligibility for the Personal Independent Payment, which provides help with extra living costs to those with a long-term physical or mental health condition, and cuts to incapacity benefits for people unable to work and receiving Universal Credit.
There is unease over the plans within the party, with Labour MP Rachael Maskell warning against ""draconian cuts"" that risk ""pushing disabled people into poverty"".
Maskell told the BBC she had picked up ""deep, deep concern"" among Labour MPs.
She said: ""I look in the past at what Labour has achieved in this space and believe that we can hold on to our values, ensure that we're helping people and not harming people.""
Another Labour MP, Neil Duncan-Jordan, also expressed concern, telling Newsnight: ""If we are going to make poor people poorer then there will be a number of MPs who won't be able to sign up to that.
""It feels like it could be a re-run of austerity and I'm worried about that.""
However, other sections of the Parliamentary Labour Party are calling for change.
The Get Britain Working group of 36 Labour MPs has said the government has a ""moral duty"" to help long-term sick and disabled people to work if they can.
In a letter to Kendall, the MPs said the country faced ""hard choices"" to overcome a ""crisis of economic inactivity"".
Speaking at a meeting of Labour MPs on Monday night, Sir Keir said: ""We've found ourselves in a worst of all worlds situation - with the wrong incentives - discouraging people from working, the taxpayer funding a spiralling bill.
""A wasted generation, one-in-eight young people not in education, employment or training, and the people who really need that safety net still not always getting the dignity they deserve.
""That's unsustainable, it's indefensible and it is unfair, people feel that in their bones.
""So, this needs to be our offer to people up and down the country: If you can work, we will make work pay - if you need help, that safety net will be there for you.
""But this is the Labour Party - we believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the dignity of every worker.""
A number of MPs leaving the meeting said they had been satisfied with the prime minister's words.
One said they accepted that welfare reform had to happen and were reassured that he had said it had to be done with Labour values and through the dignity of work.
However, another said constituents were frightened and needed to know that support would be there.
They said there had been little recognition that reducing benefits like the Personal Independence Payment, which helps people keep their independence, had the potential to push up costs.
Labour MP Diane Abbott said she would have liked to query the impact of the prime minister's proposed cuts to welfare but was told the meeting was full.

In a letter to Reeves, a dozen charities have argued there is ""little evidence to suggest cutting benefits increases employment outcomes"".
The charities - including Disability Rights UK, Citizens Advice, Scope and Sense - urged her to ""think again about cuts to disability benefits"".
They said: ""There are disabled people out of work who want to work given the right support. And for some disabled people, work isn't appropriate.
""Changes to welfare must start here. Not with cuts.""
But ministers are worried about the surge in the number of people claiming benefits since the Covid-19 pandemic and the cost to the taxpayer.
As of January, 9.3 million people aged 16 to 64 in the UK were economically inactive - a rise of 713,000 since the pandemic.
The Department of Work and Pensions says some 2.8 million people are economically inactive because of long-term sickness.
Last year, the government spent £65bn on sickness benefits and that figure is forecast to increase by tens of billions before the next general election.
Some of the reforms to the welfare systemhave already been announcedand include plans to use 1,000 work coaches to help the long-term unemployed into work.
Conservative shadow businesses secretary Andrew Griffith said Sir Keir had ""rightly"" talked about the problem of millions of working-age people on welfare.
""That is a stain on our country's character,"" Griffith told the BBC. ""But it also holds back the economy and it's one of the reasons why we're not growing.""
However, Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling said ""slashing support without fixing broken public services is not the answer"".
""We need long-term reform and investment in health and social care, not short-term cuts that balance the nation's finances on the backs of the most vulnerable,"" he said.

"Illegal working in UK was unbearable, migrant says","An Albanian national who travelled to the UK illegally has told the BBC how his life became ""unbearable"" after he ended up working on a cannabis farm.
Gzim, who wished to remain anonymous, was one of more than 12,600 Albanians who made the trip to the UK by small boat in 2022 - the peak year forEnglish Channel migrant crossings.
Last year the number of Albanians that made the dangerous journey dropped to just 616 people, following a campaign by the UK and Albanian governments.
Gzim says he is speaking out to warn others, as the UK government relaunches a social media campaign aimed at warning Albanians who enter illegally of possible hardships in the UK.
He says he found a smuggler on TikTok who agreed to help him make the journey to England, and after travelling to France via buses, he arrived in Dunkirk, where a boat was launched to Dover.
He says his cousins, who were already in the UK, paid the smuggler £3,500 for him to cross the channel.
After being placed in a hotel, he says he was able to leave unnoticed to work on a cannabis farm.
He said: ""I wanted a better life, to help my family, like all the other people who have done this journey.
""I knew the risks involved with this kind of business, but I hoped that I wouldn't be unlucky.""
He says the cannabis farm was broken into and because of this he didn't get paid.
Gzim moved into a construction role where he says he felt forced to take a lower wage - not enough to cover his own expenses and support his family back home.
Five months after arriving in the UK he said it got so ""unbearable"" he decided to return to Albania.
He added: ""I dreamed of other things. I hoped I would make it.
""Nobody wants to leave his homeland. Nobody wants to leave his people and his friends. But in Albania it is a war of survival and I didn't have any other choice.""
Newsocial mediaadverts are highlighting stories of migrants who entered the UK illegally ""only to face debt and exploitation"".
This approach originally started in 2023 under the Conservative government.
It followeda cooperation agreementsigned by the UK and Albania under the previous government to try and reduce illegal migration.
The numbers on small boats had already started to fall before the agreement was struck.
The National Crime Agency said the reduction in crossings is due toa number of different factors, including law enforcement activity, deportations, diminished demand for travel to the UK and potential displacement to other methods.
Last year more than 2,600 people were returned to Albania, more than any other nationality.
Balkans expert Andi Hoxhaj told a committee of MPs in 2022 that he estimated about 40% of people leave Albania for ""economic opportunities"".
Lavdrim Krashi, an MP in the ruling Socialist Party, said some people had been lured on social media by promises of a better life in Britain.
He told the BBC: ""The promotion was made to especially young people to come to the UK and if you make it there, don't worry about any finances because money really grows on trees, and we know that's not the case.
""The numbers travelling illegally has drastically reduced in the last few years, but always more can be done,"" he said.
""It's not in our interest to lose our young people, we want to make them thrive in the Albanian economy.""
But there are also ongoing concerns about Albanians being trafficked into the UK.
They are still among the most common nationalities referred to theNational Referral Mechanismas potential modern day slaves.
Jorida Tabaku, an opposition MP from the Democratic Party said: ""When people go there they face a different reality.
""A lot of them are paying very much to go to the UK, a lot of them are leaving families behind because they are unemployed men.""
Albanian TV journalist Eraldo Harlicaj says depopulation of the country has been an issue for years.
""We have lots of problems here again.
""Nothing has changed about Albania from 2022 when we had the peak of illegal migration,"" he said.
""Most of the young Albanians who wanted to go to England are in England, so we don't have any more to send.""
Since 2022 the British Embassy has invested £6m in a project aimed at stemming the flow of people leaving northern Albania for a life of illegal working in the UK.
The New Perspectives programme is designed to create job and business opportunities.
Vasyl Chornyi, the team leader, said: ""There are organised criminal groups using their social media, trying to lure people into trafficking scheme.
""Trying to change the narrative with a positive image that people can make their life here is extremely important,"" he added.
The project provides business mentoring and coaches people in employment and entrepreneurship skills.
Albert Halilaj, the Mayor of Kukës said: ""The number of immigrants going abroad is falling down. The young people of Kukës are not looking to migrate anymore.
""Tourism is the sole focus of the future of Kukës, and i'd like to make a public call to all the immigrants abroad that they can return here and they will find support for their investments in every field.""
The migration agreement with Britain has also resulted in closer co-operation to tackle people smuggling.
Head of the Albanian Border and Migration Police, Saimir Boshnjaku, said: ""Albanian law enforcement officers have been deployed in the UK, especially in Dover, to support the British authorities"".
A network of UK-funded cameras has also been installed on the Albania-Kosovo border to tackle illegal migration and criminal gangs.
The equipment includes afleet of dronesand number plate recognition cameras to recognise British vehicles which criminals use to avoid detection by the local police.
Minister for Europe, Stephen Doughty said: ""By working directly with Albanian communities, we are discouraging the dangerous journeys to the UK.
""Together with tougher border controls and cracking down on people-smuggling gangs, the government is focused on the international challenge and delivering on its Plan for Change.""

Musk's Tesla facilities in US face 'Takedown' protests,"Tesla facilities across the US are facing protests and vandalism in response to the political role Elon Musk, who owns the car manufacturer, has played in the Trump administration.
Most ""Tesla Takedown"" protests have been peaceful, but a few have been destructive with fires intentionally set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Colorado and Massachusetts last week.
That was followed by six arrests in New York over the weekend when hundreds of protesters occupied a Tesla showroom.
There has also been a spike in Cybertruck vandalism across the US, and some car owners are defacing their own Teslas in protest of Musk.
One woman showed up to a protest outside a Burbank Tesla on Sunday with an expletive and Musk's name scrawled in chalk across her white Model X sedan. Another car carried an ""Anti Elon Tesla Club"" sticker.
The protests illustrate a growing unease over Musk's influence on the US government since President Donald Trump allowed him to create the cost-cutting task force Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).
So far, Doge has fired or offered buyouts to about 100,000 federal employees and gained access to the sensitive personal and financial information of millions of Americans.
Critics have resorted to calling the tech billionaire ""President Musk"", arguing that he has too much power in the White House. Some at the protest in Burbank held signs that said ""Deport Elon"" and ""Boycott Swasticar"" - with protesters attempting to connect the car to fascism.
Tesla produced the must-have electric cars for many Americans with progressive views, but several protesters said they regretted their purchase after Musk involved himself with Trump and US politics.
Karen Rabwin, a protester at the Burbank Tesla on Sunday, attended just two days after trading in her Tesla for a Cadillac. She had slapped a bumper sticker on her old vehicle that read ""Bought This Car Before We Knew"" in a veiled reference to Musk, but she felt that wasn't enough.
""It was embarrassing,"" she said of driving the Tesla. ""It wasn't what I stood for. How could I drive that car? I have principles.""
Singer Sheryl Crow donated her Tesla to National Public Radio last month. She posted a video to Instagram waving goodbye to the car as it was towed away.
""There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla,"" Ms Crow wrote.
Musk has responded to the protests by sharing a video on X - the social media platform he owns - of a Cybertruck customer in Texas marvelling at the vehicle's full self-driving mode.
""Heartfelt thanks to everyone supporting Tesla, despite many attacks against our stores and offices,"" Musk wrote.
The social media platform has many posts of Tesla owners showcasing their electric cars. But there are also now videos showing a growing trend of Cybertrucks vandalised with swastikas, used as skate ramps or covered in garbage.
During Mardi Gras in New Orleans, spectators booed an orange Cybertruck and pelted it with beads, calling the futuristic looking vehicle a ""Deplorean"" or other unfriendly monikers.
Protesters on Sunday said they want to take down Telsa's value because they are concerned that Mr Musk is damaging the economy and the the country - and their efforts may be having an effect.
While Tesla's share price surged after Trump was elected - with Musk by his side on election night in Florida - they have tumbled back to pre-election levels following the  backlash to Musk's political involvement.
Some on Sunday also raised concerns that Musk's government involvement is benefiting his businesses.
Critics note that the tech entrepeneur's companies have billions of dollars of contracts with the US government, primarily with Nasa and the Defense Department, which are increasingly reliant on Musk's SpaceX for satellite launches and space exploration.
Last week, reports claimed the Musk had attempted to get the Federal Aviation Administration to cancel a $2.4bn (£1.9bn) contract with Verizon to revamp the agency's telecommunications system and awarding it to Starlink, a company owned by SpaceX, instead.
SpaceX denied that report, posting on X that ""Starlink is a possible partial fix to an aging system. There is no effort or intent for Starlink to 'take over' any existing contract"".
Some constituents are furious at Musk's involvement and the White House's effort to cut certain jobs and programmes. Many have shown up at Republican town halls to protest the cuts and the tech billionaire's growing influence.
House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republican leaders urged members of their party to stop hosting events in response, claiming without evidence that they were being disrupted by ""professional protesters"".

Ontario says it will slap a 25% surcharge on US-bound electricity,"Canada's most populous province Ontario is slapping a retaliatory 25% surcharge on electricity it sends to US states in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods.
Ontario leader Doug Ford confirmed the move in a news conference on Monday morning, saying it will increase costs for affected US customers by an average of $100 (£77.65) per month.
Roughly 1.5 million American homes and businesses in the northern border states of New York, Michigan and Minnesota will be impacted.
Ford said that the surcharge on energy will remain until the threat of tariffs from the US ""is gone for good.""
""President Trump's tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They're making life more expensive for American families and businesses,"" Ford said in a statement on Monday.
At Monday's news conference, Ford threatened to escalate further if the US increases their tariffs on Canada.
""I will not hesitate to increase this charge if necessary,"" he said. ""If the US escalates, I will not hesitate to shut off electricity completely.""
He added that he understands the tariffs are not the fault of the American people, blaming Trump solely for them. ""Believe me when I say I don't want to do this,"" Ford remarked, though he added: ""As premier, my number one job is to protect the people of Ontario.""
Ford said that Ontario will be using the revenue from its retaliatory tariffs on energy to support local workers and businesses impacted by US tariffs on Canada.
Canada's federal government has also imposed its own dollar-for-dollar reciprocal tariffs on $30bn worth of US goods exported north. The list of products impacted ranges from clothing to perfume to orange juice.
Trump responded to the surcharge in a social media post on Tuesday, saying ""your not even allowed to do that"".
He said the US would ""get it all back"" with its own reciprocal tariffs in the coming weeks.
""Canada is a Tariff abuser, and always has been, but the United States is not going to be subsidizing Canada any longer,"" he said.
President Trump has threatened Canada repeatedly with a blanket 25% tariff on all Canadian exports to the US - a move that economists have warned could result in job losses in Canada while increasing prices for Americans.
The US has threatened similar tariffs on neighbouring Mexico as well.
Last week, Trump imposed the levies but quickly reversed course, saying he would temporarily spare carmakers from tariffs until 2 April.
He later carved out further exemptions on goods shipped under North America's free trade pact, the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) agreement, which Trump signed in his first term. The measures also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser needed by US farmers - from 25% to 10%.
Trump, however, is still expected to impose tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium some time this week.
Governors from states affected by the electricity tax also responded.
Democratic New York Governor Kathy Hochul has commissioned a review of the impact of Trump's tariffs and Ford's response on energy prices and supply reliability in the state.
""These federal tariffs have been poorly conceived from the start: crafted in secret with no transparency and no clear economic rationale, they've only served to destabilize our capital markets and create uncertainty among New York families and businesses,"" she said in a statement.
The trade war tensions have rattled markets and raised fears of economic turbulence.
The S&P 500 share index, which tracks the biggest listed American companies, has plunged to its lowest point since September, after Trump imposed the tariffs last week and later declined to rule out the possibility of a recession.
In a Fox News interview that was taped on Thursday, Trump said ""I hate to predict things like that"" in response to the possibility of a severe economic downturn, after saying that the tariffs could bring about a ""period of transition.""
""It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,"" Trump said.

"'Garbage' to blame Ukraine for massive X outage, experts say","Experts have cast doubt on Elon Musk's claim that a large-scale outage which hit X was caused by hackers in Ukraine.
Platform monitor Downdetector says it had more than 1.6 million reports of problems with the social media site from users around the world on Monday.
""We're not sure exactly what happened but there was a massive cyber-attack to try and bring down the X system with IP [Internet Protocol] addresses originating in the Ukraine area,"" Musk said in an interview with the Fox Business channel.
However, Ciaran Martin, professor at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government told the BBC that explanation was ""wholly unconvincing"" and ""pretty much garbage.""
Prof Martin - former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre - says it looks as if X was targeted by what's known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, where hackers flood a server with internet traffic to prevent users from connecting to a website.
""It's not that sophisticated - it's a very old technique,"" Mr Martin told Radio 4's Today programme.
""I can't think of a company of the size and standing internationally of X that's fallen over to a DDoS attack for a very long time,"" he added.
He said the incident at X ""doesn't reflect well on their cyber security.""
Many users trying to access the platform and refresh feeds on its app and desktop site during Monday's outages were met with a loading icon.
Musk, who has been a frequent critic of Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelensky, has offered no evidence to support his claim and did not say whether or not he thought state actors were involved.
He posted on X that ""either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved"".
But Prof Martin said tracing IP addresses ""tells you absolutely nothing,"" because hackers in this situation would hijack devices from all over the world.
The BBC has approached the Ukrainian embassy in Washington DC for comment.
Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, which monitors the connectivity of web services, said its own metrics suggested the outages could well be linked to a cyber attack.
""What we've been seeing is consistent with what we've seen in past denial of service attacks, rather than a configuration or coding error in the platform,"" he told the BBC.
He said the organisation has seen several major outages spanning more than six hours on Monday, ""each having global impact"".
""This is amongst the longest X/Twitter outages we've tracked in terms of duration, and the pattern is consistent with a denial of service attack targeting X's infrastructure at scale,"" he added.
Musk has previously claimed that the platform has been targeted by DDoS attacks,but these have not been confirmed.
Like all major social networks, X is a regular target for disruptive and attention seeking attacks.
But X has a track record of falling due to these attacks much more than other larger sites like Facebook and Instagram.
In 2023, a small group of hackers called Anonymous Sudantook the site offlinein more than a dozen countries for hours in an attempt to pressurise Elon Musk into launching his Starlink service in their country.
Two men were arrestedin 2024 for being the ringleaders of the group - showing that hackers can disrupt X with DDoS attacks from anywhere in the world with the right tools and expertise.
Cyber specialists are seeing a ""sharp rise"" in DDoS attacks which are becoming ""an increasingly popular tool"" for criminals, according to Sian John, chief technology officer at cyber security company NCC Group.
""Businesses that store large amounts of sensitive data, like tech firms, financial institutions, and healthcare providers, are frequent targets,"" she said.
""But any organisation with an online presence is at risk.""

The 'anti-Trump' numbers man who may force the UK to take a side,"Mark Carney's elevation to the top job in Canada is of particular significance at this moment when his country is at the frontline of a North American trade war. He becomes the ""anti-Trump"" on the US president's doorstep.
The former Bank of England governor chose to lean strongly into resisting Donald Trump's policies at his acceptance speech. He said the US president had brought ""dark days"" from ""a country we can no longer trust"" and that he was ""proud"" of Canadians resisting the US ""with their wallets"".
While on trade specifically Mr Carney vowed to keep the retaliatory tariffs ""until Americans show us respect"", it was clear that the general threats against Canadian sovereignty are equally as important in his thinking.
Trump has repeatedly said he will use economic power to encourage Canada to become the 51st state of the US, but Carney hit back. ""The Americans want our resources, our land, our water, our country… Canada will never be part of America in any way, shape or form,"" he said.
Behind the scenes, Carney has been encouraging a very robust response to Mr Trump. As he told me last month in his only UK interview during his campaign to succeed current Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, it was necessary to""stand up to a bully"".
He ridiculed Trump's allegations of Canada's involvement in fentanyl trade, and the US president's suggestion that Canada has ripped off the US. Canada's trade deficit is caused ""entirely"" by its exports of subsidised oil, Carney told me, and ""perhaps we should ask for that subsidy back"".
He follows in the footsteps of former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi as a former top central banker who became a G7 leader. It is an otherwise rare path, but it may be good timing when Canada's nearest neighbour has suggested using economic power to take over.
Carney has experience in this area having dealt with a number of acute political-economic crises, such as the banking crash, the eurozone crisis, sterling's sharp slide after Brexit, and the start of the pandemic.
He has also regularly attended G20 meetings at leader level, including in the presence of Trump, as chair of the Financial Stability Board, an international economic body. At one such meeting, the Trump team threatened to leave the International Monetary Fund.
Carney believes that Trump only respects power. Of any attempt to mollify Trump, he said ""good luck with that"". He will focus further tariff retaliation on bringing inflation and interest rate rises to Canada's ""southern neighbour"".
The Canadian election is due by October, but Carney might call an earlier one. Depending on that, he is on course to host Trump in Canada at the G7 Summit in June.
His rise to the top job raises the stakes for the UK. On the one hand, a more robust approach from an allied G7 leader stands in contrast to the UK's attempt to hug the White House closely.
On the other hand, Carney also hinted at wanting to diversify trade towards ""more reliable"" partners, which would include the UK and EU. Canada might send its subsidised energy to Europe, rather than the US.
The bigger strategic point is that Carney's background means a focus on international solidarity, and defence of the existing multilateral system. He says Canada can ""stand on its own feet"" but sees merit in creating a more coherent international alliance to focus the minds of Congress and tariff-sceptics in the Trump administration.
Canada's new leadership expects support from its Commonwealth ally, the UK. After my recent interview with him, Carney turned the camera to the portrait on the wall of the office from which he was talking to me: King Charles. The message was clear. Canada and the UK should be on the same side in this new world era.
