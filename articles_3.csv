Annual jab for HIV protection passes trial hurdle,"An annual injection designed to guard against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has completed an important early safety trial, researchers report inThe Lancetmedical journal.
Lenacapavir stops the virus from replicating inside cells.
If future trials go well - now it has passed the first, Phase I, testing hurdle - it could become the longest-acting form of HIV prevention available.
Currently,people can take daily pills or sometimes have injections every eight weeks, for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), to reduce their risk.
PrEP tablets are highly effective but taking them every day can be difficult.
About 39.9 million people are living with HIV, 65% of them in the World Health Organization African Region, according to the most recent figures, for 2023.
And the WHO, Global Fund and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and Aids (UNAids) are all working on strategies to end the HIV epidemic by 2030, which include improving access to medicines such as PrEP.
For the trial, 40 people without HIV were injected into the muscle with lenacapavir, with no major side effects or safety concerns.
And after 56 weeks, the medicine was still detectable in their bodies.
Future trials must include more diverse participants, the researchers told the 2025Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections.
But they added: ""Yearly dosing of lenacapavir has the potential to further decrease current barriers to PrEP by increasing the uptake of, persistence on, and, therefore, scalability of PrEP.""
Richard Angell, from the Terrence Higgins Trust HIV charity, said: ""PrEP as a daily pill has been a game-changer in our HIV response.
""The prospect of 'safe' annual injectable PrEP is as exciting as it is transformational.
""It's great to see these early results that suggest injectable PrEP might be effective for up to 12 months.
""We need to get ready for its rollout now and fund sexual-health clinics to do so.""
Access to PrEP had been variable, Mr Angell said, creating inequalities.
""The oral pill is still not available in prisons, online or in community pharmacy,"" he said.
""The Scottish Medicines Consortium has finally approved two-monthly PrEP injections for use in Scotland - but we are waiting for NICE [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] approval for use in England.""

Google Chromecast users' fury at second day of TV streaming issue,"Google says it is working to fix an issue which has left many Chromecast users unable to watch content on their televisions for a second day.
The tech giant says it has sold more than 100m of these devices worldwide across various generations, with the issues specifically impacting the ""second generation"" model.
Owners of these Chromecasts have been unable to connect them to their televisions - meaning they cannot use streaming services like Netflix and YouTube on the big screen - with Chromecast Audio devices also facing issues.
And the company has warned users not to try to fix the problem themselves by performing a factory reset to affected devicesin a post on the Google Nest support forum.
""Do not factory reset your device - we will keep you all updated when the fix rolls out,"" it says.
""If you have already factory reset your device, we will provide instructions to set your device back up as soon as possible.""
But several social media users suggested Google's advice had come too late for some who had already reset their affected Chromecasts.
""Factory reset is literally the first thing I did when my Chromecast stopped working,"" wrote a user replying to Google on X.
""Google asking everyone to please not factory reset their Chromecast after hours when it's one of the most used fixes, is hilarious,""said another.
Google's Chromecast devices plug into TVs and allow users to stream content like web video and music wirelessly using a mobile device or laptop.
It also provides the ability to display anything from inside a tab on its Chrome web browser.
Customers first began to report issues affecting some Chromecasts and their ability to ""cast"" streaming content from devices to TVs on Sunday evening.
Users trying to stream content were met with alerts which said the device could not be authenticated, its connection had failed, or the Chromecast itself was ""untrusted"".
Googlesaid in August 2024it would be discontinuing Chromecast, replacing its 11-year-old device with a new Google TV system, but it promised to support existing devices with updates.
According to a report by The Register,the issue may have been caused by an expired authentication certificate.
The BBC has asked Google to confirm if this is indeed the case.
"
From chatbots to intelligent toys: How AI is booming in China,"Head in hands, eight-year-old Timmy muttered to himself as he tried to beat a robot powered by artificial intelligence at a game of chess.
But this was not an AI showroom or laboratory – this robot was living on a coffee table in a Beijing apartment, along with Timmy.
The first night it came home, Timmy hugged his little robot friend before heading to bed. He doesn't have a name for it – yet.
""It's like a little teacher or a little friend,"" the boy said, as he showed his mum the next move he was considering on the chess board.
Moments later, the robot chimed in: ""Congrats! You win."" Round eyes blinking on the screen, it began rearranging the pieces to start a new game as it continued in Mandarin: ""I've seen your ability, I will do better next time.""
China is embracing AI in its bid to become a tech superpower by 2030.
DeepSeek,the breakthrough Chinese chatbotthat caught the world's attention in January, was just the first hint of that ambition.
Money is pouring into AI businesses seeking more capital, fuelling domestic competition. There are more than 4,500 firms developing and selling AI, schools in the capital Beijing are introducing AI courses for primary and secondary students later this year, and universities have increased the number of places available for students studying AI.
""This is an inevitable trend. We will co-exist with AI,"" said Timmy's mum, Yan Xue. ""Children should get to know it as early as possible. We should not reject it.""
She is keen for her son to learn both chess and the strategy board game Go – the robot does both, which persuaded her that its $800 price tag was a good investment. Its creators are already planning to add a language tutoring programme.
Perhaps this was what the Chinese Communist Party hoped for when it declared in 2017 that AI would be ""the main driving force"" of the country's progress. President Xi Jinping is now betting big on it, as a slowing Chinese economy grapples with the blow of tariffs from its biggest trading partner, the United States.
Beijing plans to invest 10tn Chinese yuan ($1.4tn; £1tn) in the next 15 years as it competes with Washington to gain the edge in advanced tech. AI funding got yet another boost at the government's annual political gathering, which is currently under way. This comes on the heels of a 60 billion yuan-AI investment fund created in January, just days after the US further tightened export controls for advanced chips and placed more Chinese firms on a trade blacklist.
But DeepSeek has shown that Chinese companies can overcome these barriers. And that's what has stunned Silicon Valley and industry experts – they did not expect China to catch up so soon.
It's a reaction Tommy Tang has become accustomed to after six months of marketing his firm's chess-playing robot at various competitions.
Timmy's machine comes from the same company, SenseRobot, which offers a wide range in abilities – Chinese state media hailed an advanced version in 2022 that beat chess Grand Masters at the game.
""Parents will ask about the price, then they will ask where I am from. They expect me to come from the US or Europe. They seem surprised that I am from China,"" Mr Tang said, smiling. ""There will always be one or two seconds of silence when I say I am from China.""
His firm has sold more than 100,000 of the robots and now has a contract with a major US supermarket chain, Costco.
One of the secrets to China's engineering success is its young people. In 2020, more than 3.5 million of the country's students graduated with degrees in science, technology, engineering and maths, better known as STEM.
That's more than any other country in the world - and Beijing is keen to leverage it. ""Building strength in education, science and talent is a shared responsibility,"" Xi told party leaders last week.
Ever since China opened its economy to the world in the late 1970s, it has ""been through a process of accumulating talent and technology,"" says Abbott Lyu, vice-president of Shanghai-based Whalesbot, a firm that makes AI toys. ""In this era of AI, we've got many, many engineers, and they are hardworking.""
Behind him, a dinosaur made of variously coloured bricks roars to life. It's being controlled through code assembled on a smartphone by a seven-year-old.
The company is developing toys to help children as young as three learn code. Every package of bricks comes with a booklet of code. Children can then choose what they want to build and learn how to do it. The cheapest toy sells for around $40.
""Other countries have AI education robots as well, but when it comes to competitiveness and smart hardware, China is doing better,"" Mr Lyu insists.
The success of DeepSeek turned its CEO Liang Wenfeng into a national hero and ""is worth 10 billion yuan of advertising for [China's] AI industry,"" he added.
""It has let the public know that AI is not just a concept, that it can indeed change people's lives. It has inspired public curiosity.""
Six homegrown AI firms, including DeepSeek, have now been nicknamed China's six little dragons by the internet – the others are Unitree Robotics, Deep Robotics, BrainCo, Game Science, and Manycore Tech.
Some of them were at a recent AI fair in Shanghai, where the biggest Chinese firms in the business showed off their advances, from search and rescue robots to a backflipping dog-like one, which wandered the halls among visitors.
In one bustling exhibition hall, two teams of humanoid robots battled it out in a game of football, complete in red and blue jerseys. The machines fell when they clashed – and one of them was even taken off the field in a stretcher by their human handler who was keen to keep the joke going.
It was hard to miss the air of excitement among developers in the wake of DeepSeek. ""Deepseek means the world knows we are here,"" said Yu Jingji, a 26-year-old engineer.
But as the world learns of China's AI potential, there are also concerns about what AI is allowing the Chinese government to learn about its users.
AI is hungry for data - the more it gets, the smarter it makes itself and, with around a billion mobile phone users compared to just over 400 million in the US, Beijing has a real advantage.
The West, its allies and many experts in these countries believe that data gathered by Chinese apps such as DeepSeek, RedNote or TikTok can be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party. Some point to the country's National Intelligence Law as evidence of this.
But Chinese firms, including ByteDance, which owns TikTok, says the law allows for the protection of private companies and personal data. Still, suspicion that US user data on TikTok could end up in the hands of the Chinese government droveWashington's decision to ban the hugely popular app.
That same fear – where privacy concerns meet national security challenges - is hitting Deepseek. South Korea bannednew downloads of DeepSeek, while Taiwan and Australia havebarred the app from government-issued devices.
Chinese companies are aware of these sensitivities and Mr Tang was quick to tell the BBC that ""privacy was a red line"" for his company. Beijing also realises that this will be a challenge in its bid to be a global leader in AI.
""DeepSeek's rapid rise has triggered hostile reactions from some in the West,"" a commentary in the state-run Beijing Daily noted, adding that ""the development environment for China's AI models remains highly uncertain"".
But China's AI firms are not deterred. Rather, they believe thrifty innovation will win them an undeniable advantage – because it was DeepSeek's claim that it could rival ChatGPT for a fraction of the cost that shocked the AI industry.
So the engineering challenge is how to make more, for less. ""This was our Mission Impossible,"" Mr Tang said. His company found that the robotic arm used to move chess pieces was hugely expensive to produce and would drive the price up to around $40,000.
So, they tried using AI to help do the work of engineers and enhance the manufacturing process. Mr Tang claims that has driven the cost down to $1,000.
""This is innovation,"" he says. ""Artificial engineering is now integrated into the manufacturing process.""
This could have enormous implications as China applies AI on a vast scale. State media already show factories full of humanoid robots. In January, the government said that it would promote the development of AI-powered humanoid robots to help look after its rapidly ageing population.
Xi has repeatedly declared ""technological self-reliance"" a key goal, which means China wants to create its own advanced chips, to make up for US export restrictions that could hinder its plans.
The Chinese leader knows he is in for a long race – the Beijing Daily recently warned that the DeepSeek moment was not a time for ""AI triumphalism"" because China was still in ""catch-up mode"".
President Xi is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, robots and advanced tech in preparation for a marathon that he hopes China will eventually win.

Why people are cutting back their online profile,"Anita Smith has always been cautious about how much she shared online.
But her concerns increased following an abusive relationship with a partner, who later stalked her.
Although police intervened, she left the UK and also scaled back her online profile.
""I erased my online presence as much as I possibly could, including removing the locations of some posts, and a couple of Instagram accounts,"" says Ms Smith, whose name has been changed for this article.
Ms Smith, who works in communications, still has a LinkedIn account but doesn't use her full name.
""I deleted quite a few things off my LinkedIn too, lots of things that were location based, although a few posts do remain.
""I have posted recently as I'm trying to build a brand although I'm sceptical as to how much I share.""
She has kept an original private Facebook account: ""I cleanse it once a year, and check on photos and privacy of posts and where I have been tagged.""
Ms Smith has also become more aware of the terms and conditions of social media platforms.
""I follow AI trends and I know a lot of images are training AI models and we don't have ethical guidelines on how they can be used. That's another massive factor why I will never put my child on social media as the images can be used for whatever want.""
As scams become more sophisticated, research suggests that more people are concerned about the information they share online.
In a report by Statista, 39% of respondents said they were worried about how companies use their online data, while a quarter (26%) admitted to using a VPN.
There are a number of reasons why people might want to reduce their online profiles.
""First of all, people underappreciate privacy,"" says Vytautas Kaziukonis, chief executive at Surfshark, a security software company that encrypts user's online data and aims to make browsing secure.
""What might be innocent information right now might be bring you into difficulties 10 years down the line, for example, if there's a change of laws, or political environment.""
Another issue is the explosion of AI, says Mr Kaziukonis.
""Fraud is getting better and better, and one thing that is essential for all scams is having data,"" he says.
AI is getting to the stage where it can impersonate people close to you. Add to that ability any personal information shared online, then you have a ""deadly combination"", says Mr Kaziukonis.
Also, information shared online about us is collected by data brokers and sold to advertisers.
Mr Kaziukonis says the information is also available to scammers. ""It's the Wild West out there,"" he says.
So what can we do to minimise our footprints?
Firstly, it's important to think about how much information you share online.
""Don't share your home address anywhere, for example, accidently filming a video with a laptop in the background that has sensitive information on, and when you go online shopping don't add all details to every random website, for example, your date of birth,"" says Mr Kaziukonis.
""It could be leaked and used against you."" He also advises using a different email address for websites that you sign up to. ""That limits the spamming.""
It's worth remembering that under data protection law, you have the right to ask a company what data they hold on you, and request that it is deleted.
""They have to comply as otherwise they can receive huge fines,"" says Mr Kaziukonis.
Gus Hosein, executive director at charity Privacy International, recommends several ways to reduce your digital footprint.
He suggests using a VPN (virtual private network) which, for a price, offers a user more privacy when online.
He also recommends cookie-blockers and selecting web browsers with privacy controls.
""The underlying solution remains that we must keep the pressure on our governments to have strong laws to protect everyone,"" Mr Hosein says.
Karen Renaud is a computing scientist at the University of Strathclyde  working on security and privacy.
Last year she studied 15 privacy policy documents, which lay out what a company is going to do with your data.
She found that the most complicated of them would take 32 minutes to read and would require college-level education to understand.
""The situation is pretty dire,"" she says.
She advises it's a good idea to clear out the cookies on your browser from time to time, and reduce the cookies you accept.
""Also, you can stop some tracking. Google, for example, makes it possible to prevent tracking of your searches.""
Some people turn to services such as DeleteMe and Surfshark, which help remove personal information from data brokers.
Amanda Unterreiner, product manager at US-based data removal service DeleteMe, says high-profile individuals like video gamers and judges use their service as a safety measure.
""In the case of judges… because if they're announcing some decision, someone might show up at their house.""
She also mentions the case ofthe killing earlier last yearof United Healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson.
""Stories like that kind of spark regular people to think I better get protected.""
Ms Unterreiner went through the process of having her data removed when she joined the company.
""You could see every other place I had ever lived, every phone number I've ever had, every email address, on the first page of Google. If someone wanted to steal my identity… they would be able to cause some real personal damage.""
The company also offers a service to mask your house on Google Maps.
""You can look at street view, but that particular property will just be kind of very pixelated.""
There's multiple reasons why Saam Collingwood, who lives near Stratford-upon-Avon, has cut back her online profile over the years.
The first was following an incident at work where she had included her personal Facebook account on an email to a client and her employer was unhappy.
""They were able to see photos from a night out,"" she says. ""That didn't go down too well.""
In another incident she was trolled by a stranger online after posting a video of herself learning a dance routine on YouTube.
Plus, rising online fraud convinced her to further reduce her online profile.
She hasn't completely erased her online presence but she no longer posts regularly on Facebook, reducing it about twice a year.
""I don't like it when people tag me, people knowing I'm not at home. Most times I remove the tag.""
She says she has upgraded her anti-virus and security software with a service from online security firm Norton.
""I wanted to make sure websites weren't taking my details. It makes me more comfortable.""
But are there any downsides to not being so present online?
""I miss seeing old friends [on Facebook] and people I would contact once or twice year,"" says Ms Smith.
Mr Kaziukonis says it's common to hear people say they don't care about privacy but he believes this is a flawed argument.
""They say I have nothing to hide. But would they mind sharing every single email they have sent? We have curtains at home, we want to feel private. It's human nature.""

Global smartwatch sales fall for first time,"Global sales of smartwatches have fallen for the first time, new figures indicate, in large part due to a sharp decline in the popularity of market leader, Apple.
Market research firm Counterpoint says 7% fewer of the devices were shipped in 2024 compared to the year before.
Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.
It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.
""The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,"" saidCounterpointsenior research analyst Anshika Jain.
Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over adisputed patentregarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.
It retained 22% of market share in the final three months of 2024, down from 25% a year earlier.
""We've been through a period where the smartwatch has gone from being a new and exciting gadget, to something now that's stabilising - the feature set isn't changing very dramatically year over year,"" said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight.
Despite the overall decline, last year did see a massive rise in sales for Chinese-made smartwatches from brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei and Imoo.
Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.
This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.
The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.
Imoo, known in China as ""Little Genius"", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.
""The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,"" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.
But Imoo was eclipsed by a 135% rise in shipments from Beijing-based tech company Xiaomi.
Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.
""We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,"" said Mr Gebbie.
""Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.""
Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.
He said this was partly because of a ""bubble"" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.
""We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,"" he said.
""For those companies, there's been a sense that from this point onwards they would be better served by maybe making and selling products with a slightly longer lifespan.""
Counterpoint says it expects a small recovery in the global market, with ""single-digit percentage growth in 2025"".
It predicts the uptick in sales will be driven by the increasing adoption of AI features, and a greater emphasis of providing a wider range of health data.

How a tiny village became India's YouTube capital,"In Tulsi, a village in central India, social media has sparked an economic and social revolution. It's a microcosm of YouTube's effect on the world.
As villagers head into the fields of Tulsi, a village outside Raipur in central India, on a muggy September morning, 32-year-old YouTuber Jai Varma asks a group of women to join him for his latest video. They gather around him – adjusting their sarees and sharing a quick word and a smile.
Varma places an elderly woman on a plastic chair, asks another to touch her feet and a third to serve water, staging a scene of a rural village festival for fans who will enjoy his content from cities and countries thousands of kilometres away. The women, familiar with this kind of work, are happy to oblige. Varma captures the moment, and they return to their farmwork.
A few hundred metres away, another group is busy setting up their own production. One holds up a mobile phone, filming as 26-year-old Rajesh Diwar moves to the rhythm of a hip-hop track, his hands and body animated in the expressive style of a seasoned performer.
Tulsi is like any other Indian village. The small outpost in the central state of Chhattisgarh is home to one-storey houses and partially paved roads. A water storage tank peers out above the buildings, overseeing the town. Banyan trees with concrete bases serve as gathering spots. But what sets Tulsi apart is its distinction as India's ""YouTube Village"".
Some 4,000 people live in Tulsi, andreportssuggestmore than1,000 of them work on YouTube in some capacity. Walk around the village itself and it's hard to find someone who hasn't appeared in one of the many videos being filmed there.
The money that YouTube brings has transformed the local economy, locals say, and beyond financial benefits, the social media platform has become an instrument for equality and social change. The residents who've launched successful YouTube channels and found new streams of income include a number of women who previously had few opportunities for advancement in this rural setting. Under the banyan trees, conversations have turned to technology and the internet.
February 2025 marks the 20th anniversary of YouTube. Approximately2.5 billion people use the platformper month by some estimates, and India isone of YouTube's biggest marketsby far. Over the decades, YouTube has changed not only the web but the entire way we think about creating and consuming human culture. In a way, Tulsi village is a microcosm of YouTube's effect on the world itself, where for some, their entire lives revolve around online videos.
""It is keeping the children away from bad habits and crime,"" says Netram Yadav, 49, a farmer in Tulsi and one of the many admirers of the village's burgeoning social media scene. ""These content creators have made everyone in the village proud for what they have been able to achieve and do.""
Tulsi's Youtube transformation started back in 2018, when Varma and his friend Gyanendra Shukla launched a YouTube channel calledBeing Chhattisgarhiya.""We were not content with our routine lives, and wanted to do something that would allow our creative juices to flow,"" Varma says.
Their third video, about a young couple being harassed on Valentines Day by members ofBajrang Dal, a right wing Hindu nationalist group, was the first to go viral. The mix of comedy and social commentary struck a chord. ""The video was humorous, but it also had a message, and we left it open for viewers to interpret,"" Varma says.
The duo gained tens of thousands of followers in a matter of months, a number that's since spread to over 125,000 subscribers and a cumulative viewership exceeding 260 million. Their families' concerns about dedicating so much time to social media were silenced when the money started flowing in. ""We were earning over 30,000 rupees [about £278 or $346] a month, and were able to support the team members who helped us,"" Shukla says. He and Varma left their jobs to pursue YouTube full-time.
Their success was soon an inspiration to other Tulsi residents. Shukla says his team paid their actors and even provided training for others in editing and script writing. Some villagers created their own channels, while others were content to volunteer.
It was enough to attract attention from local officials. Impressed by the success of the village content creators, the state governmentestablished a state-of-the-art studioin the village in 2023. Sarveshwar Bhure, former collector – a senior civil servant – of the Raipur district which includes Tulsi, says he saw the village's YouTube work as an opportunity to address thedigital divide. ""I wanted to bridge the gap between rural and urban life by providing this studio,"" Bhure says. ""Their videos are impactful, with strong themes, and have reached millions. Setting up a studio was a way to motivate them.""
The bet paid off. YouTube has created a livelihood for hundreds of young people in the village, Bhure says. It's stoking a regional entertainment industry and launching some Tulsi YouTubers out of their small-town life.
Of all the social media stars born in Tulsi's YouTube frenzy, none has risen higher than 27-year-old Pinky Sahoo. Growing up in a remote village built around agriculture, Sahoo's aspirations of becoming an actress and dancer felt like a distant fantasy – thanks especially to disapproval from family and neighbours who saw acting as taboo.
Despite their criticism, Sahoo started posting dance videos on Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. Her breakthrough came when the founders of Being Chhattisgarhiya spotted her videos and recruited her for their own productions. ""It was a dream come true,"" Sahoo recalls. ""They recognised my talent and honed my skills.”
The momentum continued as her work with Being Chattisgarhiya caught the attention of local filmmakers in Chattisgarh's regional cinema business, and Sahoo was cast in her first movie role. She's since appeared in seven films. Anand Manikpuri, a producer and director in the nearby city of Bilaspur, was impressed by her YouTube performances. ""I was looking for a fresh face who could act, and Sahoo had it all,"" he says.
Tulsi resident Aditya Bhagel was still in college when, inspired by Varma and Shukla, he decided to start his own channel. Adapting their techniques, he grew to over 20,000 followers within a year and started earning money from YouTube. Eventually, Varma recruited him for a writing and directing job on the Being Chattisgarhiya team. ""It was like meeting celebrities,"" Bhagel says, recalling his first meeting with Varma and Shukla.
More like this:
•YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know
•How America fell in love with China's memes
•Are India's TikTok ghosts the app's US future?
A job in the production house in the nearby city of Raipur soon followed, where he was hired based on his YouTube work. That streak continued when Bhagel landed a role as a scriptwriter and assistant director for an upcoming, big-budget movie titled Kharun Paar. ""I can only hope that one day I get to work in tinsel town,"" he says.
Yet another YouTuber turned cinema professional is 38-year-old Manoj Yadav. He had his first acting role as a child, portraying a young Lord Rama in an annual reenactment of the Hindu epic the Ramayana. Yadav never imagined that those claps would one day echo in cinema halls across Chhattisgarh.
After years of showcasing his talent in YouTube videos, Yadav landed a role in a regional film, one that earned widespread praise for his acting skills. Today, Yadav has not only made a name for himself but built an entire livelihood through his craft. ""None of this would have been possible without YouTube,"" he says ""I can't put my feelings into words.""
In Tulsi, YouTube has paved the way for women to take centre stage in this technological revolution.
According to Draupadi Vaishnu, the former Sarpanch, or village head of Tulsi, YouTube can play a crucial role in challenging biases and changing societal norms in India, wheredomestic abuseremains a prevalent issue. ""It's common for women to perpetuate [misogynistic practices], especially in how they treat their daughters-in-law. These videos help break those cycles,"" Vaishnu says.
Recently the 61-year-old starred in a video addressing the subject. ""I was glad to take on that role because it promoted the importance of treating women with respect and equality, a value I championed during my time as village head,"" she says.
Rahul Varma (no relation to Jai Varma), a 28-year old wedding photographer who learned the art from YouTube from his fellow villagers, says the platform has been transformative. ""At first, our mothers and sisters were just helping out. Now, they're running their own channels. It's not something we would have imagined before,"" he says. Even his 15-year-old nephew assists the village content creators, Varma says. ""It is a serious business here, everyone participates.""
There was an explosion of rural content creators in India during the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly on TikTok, beforeIndia banned the app in 2020. That initial wave was primarily driven by men, says Shriram Venkatraman, an assistant professor at the University of Southern Denmark who studies the impacts of social media in India. However, there are a lot more women running successful social media channels post pandemic, Venkatraman says, and that's created new economic opportunities.
""The amount of global connections that it has brought about is transformative, to say the least,"" he says, for both men and women. ""Some even start other businesses from YouTube using their subscribers and content consumers as their initial customer base, for example, hair oil and homemade spices/masalas.""
But for some, money is beside the point. ""I love contributing to the videos produced by my village’s channels, and I do it without expecting anything in return,"" says 56-year-old Ramkali Varma (also no relation to Jai Varma), a homemaker who has emerged as the go-to actress for roles portraying loving mothers, making her one of the village's most sought-after talents.
Ramkali's acting roles often address gender issues. A favourite was a supportive mother-in-law who encourages her daughter-in-law to pursue further education, she says. ""I've been able to advocate for women's education and success. Acting brings me satisfaction and peace of mind.""
Now a successful and self-reliant actress, Sahoo hopes to inspire other young girls. ""If I can achieve my dreams, they can too,"" she says, reflecting on the pride of watching her performance on the big screen with her father. In Tulsi, Sahoo has become a role model for young women. ""Seeing girls dream big and aim high is the most rewarding part of my journey. There are girls now who aspire to become filmmakers,"" she says.
As the sun sets over Tulsi, Diwar and his team work tirelessly to perfect their hip hop beats. ""Switching from content creation to rap music hasn't been easy,"" says Diwar, whose channel's name is Lethwa Raja, which loosely translates to ""Amazing King"".
Diwar hopes YouTube can be a vector for other cultural shifts for his people. ""Not many people rap in our language, but I believe I can change that,"" he says. ""I want to bring a new sound to our region and make Tulsi known for its music as much as its videos.""

'Meat intolerance': Can our bodies forget how to digest flesh?,"Some people who stop eating meat have reported unpleasant effects when they return to it. Can your body forget how to digest flesh?
Eating less meat is one of the simplest ways to reduce your carbon footprint.
If everyone in the UK moved to a low-meat diet, eating less than 50g, or one Cumberland sausage’s worth of meat a day, it would save as much carbon as if eight million cars were parked for good,researchers have calculated.Data from the UK government shows that meat consumption is dropping –between 1980 and 2022, consumption of beef, pork, and lamb fell by 62%– and though the reasons citedvary, and may have more to do with rising costs than an environmental conscientiousness, more and more people are clearly experimenting with saying no to meat.
But if you go a long time without eating it, does that change your body's ability to digest it? Vegetarians and vegans sometimespost on social media, askingwhether going back to meat could cause stomach pain, bloating, and other symptoms. Others weigh in with their own experiences, and a great, late-night whirlwind of curiosity and cramps is born.
However, there isn’t much research on whether consuming meat after a long break can trigger an upset stomach, says Sander Kersten, a professor of nutrition at Cornell University in the US. ""A lack of evidence doesn't mean it doesn't exist, it's just that people haven't studied it,"" he reflects. ""That's not always a satisfying situation or answer, but it's just what you have to deal with sometimes.""
It is possible – though it is very rare – to be allergic to meat. Alpha-gal syndrome, in which the immune system recognises animal proteins as invaders,can lead to anaphylaxis and death. But this allergy, which can crop up after a lifetime of cheerful meat eating, is not related to switching to a low-meat diet. You can, for example, develop the condition after a tick bite.
For many who are avoiding meat, discovering that they have unknowingly consumed it can be emotionally painful – it can feel like a personal violation, says Kersten, who is a vegetarian himself. ""That would make some people extremely sad,"" he explains. "" I don't know if that would lead to physical symptoms. It certainly could trigger a lot of anger.""
But when you consider the biology of digestion, it is not as plausible as you might imagine that the body could, over a long period of time, lose the ability to digest meat. Meat is generally very easily digested, unlike the fibre in fruits, vegetables, and legumes. To break that up, our bodies require help from our microbiome, whose microbes do possess the enzymes necessary for digesting it.
Moreover, the enzymes used to digest plant proteins are the same as those used on meat proteins. These enzymes recognise and sever particular chemical bonds in proteins. Whether they come from plants or animals, the proteins are made of building blocks called amino acids. Enzymes can generally break them up no matter where they came from.
This process is different from the case of, say, animal milk sugars like lactose. To digest lactose, your body requires a specific enzyme called lactase, and people who do not produce enough of the enzyme, making them lactose intolerants, can suffer a tummy upset after eating dairy products.
But with meat proteins, it does not make sense to think of the body somehow ceasing to make the enzymes necessary to digest a hamburger comfortably – they're always there, breaking down any protein that comes through, be it from pea, soybeans, or steaks, says Kersten.
The human gut microbiome does morph and change depending on what its host eats, though. Sometimes this means that the specific types of bacteria there change; sometimes it's just that the microbes make other enzymes. While there are differences between the microbiomes of omnivores and vegetarians and vegans, theydo not seem to be radically divergent, so long as the omnivores consume a variety of plants, research has found.
Microbiomes can shift quickly as a result of dietary changes, however – one study in which people switched to a fully animal-based diet showed that a shift away from their baseline microbiomewas visible within a day(it swiftly reverted back to normal once the diet ended). Subjects were encouraged to report any discomfort they felt, but nothing made it into the paper.
More like this:
•How a month of abstinence can lead to meat disgust
•The rise and fall and possible rise of the oyster
•The complicated history of gelatine
If anything, it's the sudden consumption of large amounts of fibre after a long hiatus that could cause digestive problems. It's better to ease into such dietary changes. ""Depending on the fibre, you can have some pretty strong reactions to it,"" says Kersten.
In short, worrying about your body somehow losing the ability to digest meat shouldn't impair any plans you have to extend Veganuary into the spring. If you're among those who've had an upset stomach after eating meat following a long hiatus, a loss of enzymes is not likely to be the culprit, though this phenomenon remains understudied, Kersten says.
""The body is quite adaptable,"" he continues. ""It can do more than you think.""

"Facebook was 'hand in glove' with China, BBC told","A former senior Facebook executive has told the BBC how the social media giant worked ""hand in glove"" with the Chinese government on potential ways of allowing Beijing to censor and control content in China.
Sarah Wynn-Williams - a former global public policy director - says in return for gaining access to the Chinese market of hundreds of millions of users, Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, considered agreeing to hiding posts that were going viral, until they could be checked by the Chinese authorities.
Ms Williams - who makes the claims in a new book - has also filed a whistleblower complaint with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging Meta misled investors. The BBC has reviewed the complaint.
Facebook's parent company Meta, says Ms Wynn-Williams had her employment terminated in 2017 ""for poor performance"".
It is ""no secret we were once interested"" in operating services in China, it adds. ""We ultimately opted not to go through with the ideas we'd explored.""
Meta referred us to Mark Zuckerberg's comments from 2019, when he said: ""We could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they [China] never let us in.""
Facebook also used algorithms to spot when young teenagers were feeling vulnerable as part of research aimed at advertisers, Ms Wynn-Williams alleges.
A former New Zealand diplomat, she joined Facebook in 2011, and says she watched the company grow from ""a front row seat"".
Now she wants to show some of the ""decision-making and moral compromises"" that she says went on when she was there. It is a critical moment, she adds, as ""many of the people I worked with… are going to be central"" to the introduction of AI.
In her memoir, Careless People, Ms Wynn-Williams paints a picture of what she alleges working on Facebook's senior team was like.
Mr Zuckerberg, she says, did not get up before midday, loved karaoke and did not like to be beaten at board games, such as Risk. ""I didn't realise that you were supposed to let him win. I was a little naive,"" she told us.
However, Ms Wynn-Williams says her allegations about the company's close relationship with China provide an insight into Facebook's decision-making at the time.
""China is Mark Zuckerberg's white whale,"" meaning a goal that he obsessively pursued, says Ms Wynn-Williams.
The country is the world's biggest social media market, but access to Facebook remains blocked there, alongside the likes of X and YouTube.
""It's the one piece on the board game that he hasn't conquered,"" she says.
Ms Wynn-Williams claims that in the mid-2010s, as part of its negotiations with the Chinese government, Facebook considered allowing it future access to Chinese citizens' user data.
""He was working hand in glove with the Chinese Communist Party, building a censorship tool… basically working to develop sort of the antithesis of many of the principles that underpin Facebook,"" she told the BBC.
Ms Wynn-Williams says governments frequently asked for explanations of how aspects of Facebook's software worked, but were told it was proprietary information.
""But when it came to the Chinese, the curtain was pulled back,"" she says.
""Engineers were brought out. They were walked through every aspect, and Facebook was making sure these Chinese officials were upskilled enough that they could not only learn about these products, but then test Facebook on the censorship version of these products that they were building.""
Meta told the BBC that such claims about China had been ""widely reported"" at the time.
In her SEC complaint, Ms Wynn-Williams also alleges Mr Zuckerberg and other Meta executives had made ""misleading statements… in response to Congressional inquiries"" about China.
One answer given by Mr Zuckerberg to Congress in 2018 said Facebook was ""not in a position to know exactly how the [Chinese] government would seek to apply its laws and regulations on content""
Meta told the BBC that Mr Zuckerberg gave accurate testimony, adding it did not operate services in China.
Most Facebook executives didn't allow their own children on Facebook - according to Ms Wynn-Williams. ""They had screen bans. They certainly wouldn't allow them to use the product.""
And yet she saysreports from 2017- that the company had been using algorithms to target and categorise vulnerable teens - were true.
""The algorithm could infer that they were feeling worthless or unhappy,"" she alleges.
The company - which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp - could, she claims, identify when a teenage girl had deleted a selfie on its platforms, and then notify a beauty company that it would be a good moment to target the child with an advert.
Ms Wynn-Williams says she ""felt sick"" at the thought and tried to push back, ""although I knew it was futile"".
""They said: 'The business side thinks this is exactly what we should be doing. We've got this amazing product, we can get young people, which is a really important advertising segment.'""
Meta told the BBC this was false - it has never offered tools to target people based on their emotional state - and that the research it previously did was to help marketers understand how people express themselves on Facebook, not to target ads.
Overall, Ms Wynn-Williams says the company has not done enough to address the issue of young people's safety on social media.
""This is one of the most valuable companies in the world. They could invest in this and make it a real priority and do more to fix it.""
Facebook said it was transparent about advert-targeting andhad shared updates regarding its approachto creating age-appropriate advert experiences for teens.
It also said it had introduced ""Teen Accounts"" for tens of millions of young people with built-in protections. It also said it was giving parents more oversight over their teens' use of the app.
As well as poor performance, Meta says the 45-year-old was also fired for ""toxic behaviour"" after she had made ""misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment"".
But Ms Wynn-Williams told the BBC she was let go after she had complained about inappropriate comments by one of her bosses - Joel Kaplan, who is now Meta's chief global affairs officer.
Meta told us she had been paid by ""anti-Facebook activists"" and she was not a whistleblower.
""Whistleblower status protects communications to the government, not disgruntled activists trying to sell books,"" it said.
In regard to Ms Wynn-Williams' book, Meta has confirmed to the BBC that it has launched legal action in the US to ""halt the further distribution of defamatory and untrue information"".
To counter this, a legal representative for Ms Wynn-Williams said: ""Meta has made a number of false and inconsistent statements about Sarah since the news of her memoir broke... while Meta's statements are trying to mislead the public, the book speaks for itself"".
We asked her why she was speaking out now. She said she wanted Meta to change as it ""influences so much of our day-to-day life"" and we need to ensure ""we get the future we deserve"".
""We're in this moment where tech and political leaders are coming together and as they combine forces, that has a lot of consequences for all of us.
""I think it's really important to understand that and to understand you look at all these engineers who are influencing the highest level of government.""

Annual jab for HIV protection passes trial hurdle,"An annual injection designed to guard against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has completed an important early safety trial, researchers report inThe Lancetmedical journal.
Lenacapavir stops the virus from replicating inside cells.
If future trials go well - now it has passed the first, Phase I, testing hurdle - it could become the longest-acting form of HIV prevention available.
Currently,people can take daily pills or sometimes have injections every eight weeks, for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), to reduce their risk.
PrEP tablets are highly effective but taking them every day can be difficult.
About 39.9 million people are living with HIV, 65% of them in the World Health Organization African Region, according to the most recent figures, for 2023.
And the WHO, Global Fund and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and Aids (UNAids) are all working on strategies to end the HIV epidemic by 2030, which include improving access to medicines such as PrEP.
For the trial, 40 people without HIV were injected into the muscle with lenacapavir, with no major side effects or safety concerns.
And after 56 weeks, the medicine was still detectable in their bodies.
Future trials must include more diverse participants, the researchers told the 2025Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections.
But they added: ""Yearly dosing of lenacapavir has the potential to further decrease current barriers to PrEP by increasing the uptake of, persistence on, and, therefore, scalability of PrEP.""
Richard Angell, from the Terrence Higgins Trust HIV charity, said: ""PrEP as a daily pill has been a game-changer in our HIV response.
""The prospect of 'safe' annual injectable PrEP is as exciting as it is transformational.
""It's great to see these early results that suggest injectable PrEP might be effective for up to 12 months.
""We need to get ready for its rollout now and fund sexual-health clinics to do so.""
Access to PrEP had been variable, Mr Angell said, creating inequalities.
""The oral pill is still not available in prisons, online or in community pharmacy,"" he said.
""The Scottish Medicines Consortium has finally approved two-monthly PrEP injections for use in Scotland - but we are waiting for NICE [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] approval for use in England.""

'You look up and see light coming through': The divers venturing under the ice in the name of science,"It is a world cut off from our own by thick blankets of floating ice, but some scientists are taking the plunge to learn how these frozen depths are changing.
There is a 70cm-thick (28in) layer of ice capping the surface of this lake, in a remote corner of Lapland, northern Finland. Gathered around a hole cut into the ice is a group of around 20 people, peering down into the inky depths with some trepidation. The seemingly lifeless water below the ice has a temperature only slightly above 0C (32F). Some of them are about to jump down there to venture under the ice.
Sophie Kalkowski-Pope is one of the divers preparing visit this strange, upside-down world where she will swim below a ceiling of smooth ice. The marine biology graduate from the University of Queensland, Australia, is part of an ice-diving training party that has gathered here. She is wearing a dry suit and anticipating the initial cold shock when that frigid water will hit the exposed skin on her face.
It's so numbing in these Arctic waters that, even with thermal clothing and special insulating gloves, divers find it hard to use their hands after just 30 minutes underwater. There are other dangers, too, so strict safety protocols are in place. Divers are tethered to the surface using a safety rope, with a handler on the surface communicating with the diver via rope signals. One tug for ""ok"", two tugs for ""stop"", three for ""come back"".
A standby diver waits nearby in full gear, ready to enter the water if there's an emergency. And there are two holes cut in the ice next to each other so there are two exit points.
The lines of rope linking divers back to the surface could become entangled in submerged branches or logs, other debris, or even the diver's own equipment such as fins or tanks.
The training here on a frozen lake is practice for work that will be done out on the sea ice of the Arctic and Antarctic, where there are added dangers – large seals sometimes gather at the dive holes, preventing divers from leaving the water.
With one final check of her equipment, Kalkowski-Pope puts her breathing apparatus in her mouth – and flings herself in.
Today, ice is still a key feature of the Arctic but it is becoming less and less common. Because of climate change, theArctic is warming four times fasterthan the rest of the world. Satellite data reveals the area of sea ice covering the Arctic Ocean has declined by around13.2% per decade, on average, since monitoring began in 1979.
Scientists, driven to understand the changes unfolding here, are going to extremes to carry out their fieldwork. Some are learning ice diving techniques, so that they may observe underwater Arctic ecosystems and document the hastening retreat of the ice. Their short, and sometimes dangerous, expeditions are revealing the secrets of a rapidly thawing world.
""Once you get in the water, you realise what a beautiful environment you're in and you calm down a bit,"" says Kalkowski-Pope as she describes the natural trepidation that people have ahead of an ice dive.
She has come to Kilpisjärvi in Lapland, over 248 miles (400km) north of the Arctic Circle, to join other divers from all over the world on an ice diving training course. The trainees plod gingerly around two rectangular entry holes that they've cut in the lake's ice.
It may be the middle of March but it still feels very much like winter here. The lake is frozen over and surrounded by Finland's highest fells, still draped in thick snow.
Perry Brandes, a commercial diver from Florida, where he is used to a far warmer climate, has just completed his first ice dive. ""It's very peaceful,"" he says. ""You look up and see light coming through. It's like looking at a city from afar."" This, he explains, is the sun peeking through holes in the ice above. Those twinkling lights are like beacons that guide the divers back to the surface. (You can read more about what it is like under the ice in Antarctica inKatherine Latham's fascinating article about this upside down ice-scape.)
Kalkowski-Pope and Brandes are two of 12 participants on the week-long polar research diving course, which has been organised by the University of Helsinki.
All of those taking part are already seasoned divers who have honed their skills in temperate and tropical waters. This is the next level. Should they master ice diving here, it could enable them to join scientific diving expeditions in the Arctic or Antarctic.
""There's probably only a few hundred people in the world who can do polar base diving work at the moment,"" says Edd Stockdale, coordinator of the Finnish Scientific Diving Academy, who leads the course. ""Thepolar areas are melting. We need scientists who are able to monitor what's happening,"" he explains.
Scientific research in the polar regions is critically important for climate change monitoring.The melting of polar ice contributes to rising sea levels around the world.By studying changes in sea ice, scientists are able to gain a better understanding of how quickly climate change is unfolding.
Ice diving, in particular, allows researchers to collect first-hand data on ice thickness, density and movement as well as water temperatures and salinity. The polar regions also have unique flora and fauna adapted to living in extremely cold conditions, and some of these organisms are visible during ice dives.
In 2017, Alf Norkko, a professor of marine research at the University of Helsinki, and his team discovered bigchanges on the seafloor under Antarctic sea icesince their previous diving expedition in the same area in 2009.
""There was a remarkable increase in the abundance of life,"" he says. Levels of chlorophyll and other plant compounds deposited in the sediment on the sea floor had risen dramatically, indicating that the amount of plankton and algae in the water had increased. ""In just a few years, the sea ice had got thinner, which allowed more light to get through so there was more food supply for starfish, worms, sponges and sea spiders on the seafloor.""
A recently published study of kelp forests off the coast of the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard saw diversmake repeated trips to the same site over a 25 year periodto examine how warming temperatures were affecting these important ecosystem by changing the mix of seaweed growing there.
Data collected by research divers from the British Antarctic Survey's Rothera Research Station also recently helped to show that the coastal seabed off the West Antarctic Peninsula ismore frequently being struck by icebergsdue to reductions in sea ice. These collisions cause catastrophic damage, killing almost everything in their path and scouring enormous scars along the seabed.
Norkko adds that it is helpful for scientists from many different fields to take part in the ice dives. ""It's not enough for a marine biologist to go down and count the starfish on the sea floor,"" he says. ""We need multidisciplinary teams with a chemist and a physicist to go down and connect the dots."" This enables researchers to more comprehensively describe the range of physical and biological processes that occur in these waters.
However, such fieldwork is risky. ""It's dangerous. You can't make any mistakes,"" warns Finnish explorer Pata Degerman, who also teaches on the course. ""It's like diving in a cave in a sense that the ice is a roof above your head. You can't just go up anywhere you need to find an exit hole.""
Pre-dive, the trainees don special clothing to protect themselves from the extreme cold: thermal underwear beneath a dry suit, gloves, and a neoprene hood that covers their head and neck. Even so, they can't stay in the water for long. Their hands lose dexterity quickly in the freezing conditions. Instructors say most divers can't use their hands properly after about 30 minutes beneath the ice.
Divers on the training course descend into the water in pairs to a depth of 12m (39ft) while tethered to a safety line, which is standard procedure for ice diving. This safety line takes the form of a sturdy rope that physically connects divers to the surface. On the training course at Kilpisjärvi, each line is tended by one of the trainees, who is tasked with managing slack and making sure the line doesn't get entangled.
""Your guideline is like a baby's umbilical cord. You can see you're connected and you feel safe,"" says Brandes.
The safety line is also the only means of communication that divers have with their colleagues at the surface. Five minutes after entering the water, a diver will pull hard on the rope to signal that they are OK and that things are progressing as planned. The tender on the surface pulls their end of the cord to acknowledge the message. ""This gets repeated every five minutes during the dive,"" explains Degerman. ""It's very simple but it works.""
If there's no reply, or the tenders feel that something is wrong, emergency procedures kick in. A diver is always waiting on standby at the surface, ready to attach themselves to the line and jump in to find out what's going on. Once they reach the silent diver, they might need to give them air or even push them upwards and back out of the hole, adds Degerman.
Among the things that can go wrong are problems with regulators, the devices divers use to breathe while underwater. The moisture in a diver's breath can actually freeze and cause the regulator to malfunction, says Degerman.
During the week-long course, there were a number of ""free flows"",  situations in which the regulator delivered air continuously at full flow, rather than in a controlled manner synchronized with a diver's inhalations. These free flow events are more likely when diving in cold water as regulators can freeze more easily. When a diver inhales, the regulator reduces high-pressure air from the tank to ambient pressure. In freezing water, this can cause moisture in the regulator to form ice that can jam the valve open, leading to a continuous flow of air making it hard to breathe properly.
To remedy the problem, divers can switch over to their backup system. If that doesn't work, they have to get the attention of their diving buddy so that they can begin sharing their air supply and return to the surface.
Ice divers don't wear a full face mask because that would make it difficult to remove during a free flow incident. But this means they experience a significant cold shock upon entering the water.
""I'd never dived in cold water before,"" says Kalkowski-Pope. ""Going beneath the ice layer for the first time and feeling the cold water on my face was really unique.""
Despite the challenges of ice diving, Norkko says he's never had an accident on any of his polar expeditions. He puts that down to preparedness, training, and assessing and managing risks carefully.
""People worry about different things but I think the biggest risk is dry suit flooding, especially in Antarctica,"" he says. ""We have salt water there that freezes less easily: it's -2C (28F), which gives you a bad cold shock.""
Seals sometimes sit over dive holes, blocking a diver's exit from the water. ""You can't get past a 300kg (47st) seal,"" laughs Norkko. ""That's why we always have two holes.""
While there are clearly risks in doing this work, the chance to gather crucial data makes them worth taking, says Anni Makinen, who works as a scientific diver for an environmental consultancy in Finland: ""I'd like to help to get some scientific knowledge that will influence politicians.""
Ice diving research projects still need willing humans like Makinen. While robots and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are increasingly important for scientific fieldwork,including in the Arctic, there are things that machines will never be able to do, stresses Rodd Budd from New Zealand's National Institute of Atmospheric Research and coordinator of Antarctica New Zealand's dive operations.
""An ROV can only see what's directly in front of it, so it may go past something interesting,"" he explains. In some cases wild animals such as seals orwhite whales have been used to collect datafrom under the ice by attaching sensors to them, but they can't be controlled to go where researchers might want. Human divers, on the other hand, naturally take in a wider field of view and can adjust their explorations depending on what they deem most important to investigate.
Plus, humans are less intrusive, says Perry Brandes, the Floridian diver, who notes that ROVs create a lot of noise and shine powerful lights ahead of them. Human divers can be much less disruptive. ""Many of the animals actually look at us divers,"" adds Brandes. ""There's an interaction between us.""
Norkko says that he and his fellow scientists are so dedicated to this work because they are aware of the urgency of climate change. At present, there is a race afoot to understand it, and to respond to it.
""Climate change is progressing at such a rate that decisions are sometimes not made with the best available scientific knowledge. This is a problem. We need to keep science at the front,"" says Norkko.
But there is also the alluring thrill of fieldwork like this. Going to places where few humans can, in order to document our planet a little better. That, too, says Norkko, keeps researchers like him returning to the dark world under the ice. ""There is, of course, also an element of adventure that drives us.""

Five years on: The countries that never locked down for Covid-19,"Most of the world found itself confined to their homes in March 2020 as Covid-19 spread at a blistering pace. Some countries didn't impose any lockdown restrictions – so was their decision the right one?
In March 2020, billions of people stared out through their windows at a world they no longer recognised. Suddenly confined to their homes, their lives had shrunk abruptly to four walls and computer screens.
Around the world, national leaders appeared on television, telling them to stay put – only leave the house to buy essential supplies or for once-daily exercise, maybe. It was a last-ditch attempt to curb the spread of a terrifying virus that had already killedmany thousands of peopleworldwide.
In London, theatre worker Tony Beckingham and his partner decided to use their daily exercise to cycle into the centre of the city one evening. ""We thought it'd be really fun to see no-one around,"" he says. It wasn't. Places the pair knew well, like Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square, perennially abuzz with people, were chillingly quiet. ""It was really upsetting – instantly,"" says Beckingham.
This deletion of the public from city streets, venues and businessesfirst began in China, where Covid-19 emerged. Quarantine orders were soon replicated in other countries after the World Health Organization (WHO)declared a pandemicon 11 March 2020. At no prior point in human history have people faced restrictions like this on such a scale.
But a handful of countries did things differently.Sweden,Taiwan,Uruguay,Icelandand a few others never enacted a lockdown that involved severe restrictions on the movement of people, such as legally binding stay-at-home orders applied across large swathes of the population. Those countries instead chose other measures, such as restrictions on large gatherings of people, extensive testing and quarantining infected people or travel restrictions.
Five years later, the scientific studies and data have piled up, offering a detailed, long-term assessment of whether these countries were right to reject this most drastic of public health interventions.
The Swedish city of Gothenburg is a haven for dog-lovers, says HR administrator and blogger Anna Mc Manus, ""We have a very dog-friendly city here,"" she says. ""We even have a dog-friendly cinema."" As countries around the world, including Sweden's neighbours Norway, Finland and Denmark, ushered in national lockdowns in March 2020, Mc Manus was aware that her own government haddecided to buck the trend.
She heard how dog owners in some nations couldn't even take their pets out for walks because of lockdown rules. South Africawas one such country. This struck Mc Manus as terrible. At the time,she wrote a blog postin which she said, ""I am convinced that my government is acting in a secure and correct way"". However, she also expressed concern that her fellow Swedes were not always following the officialpublic health guidelines around social distancing, such as limiting the number of people who could meet together in a group.
Mc Manus remembers taking frequent walks in beauty spots, but also that she and her colleagues continually wore masksto help prevent Covid-19 transmissionat the veterinary hospital where she worked in 2020. Plus, she and her partner avoided restaurants and meeting up with lots of other people. Even now, Mc Manus says she is not sure what to make of Sweden's official strategy.
""I want to base it on facts – like how many people died,"" she says. ""Could we have saved a lot more people if we had had a lockdown?""
Scientists have tried to answer that question. Ingeborg Forthun at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and researchers in other countries including Swedenpublished a study in May 2024that compared excess deaths in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland during the first years of the pandemic.
While Sweden avoided strict government imposed controls, instead relying mainly onvoluntary behavioural changesfrom is citizens, the other three nations imposedstrict lockdownsin the early stages of the pandemic.Norway,FinlandandDenmarkclosed schools and most other aspects of public life while also asking people to work from home, but they stopped short of confining people to their homes in the way other countriessuch as the UKdid.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the researchers found a noticeable spike in excess deaths in Sweden during the initial waves of the pandemic during the spring and winter of 2020, when Covid-19 was able to spread more freely than in neighbouring nations. But while excess mortality fell in the three other countries in 2020, it rose compared to Sweden in 2021 and 2022.
""The four countries have a comparable number of excess deaths when you account for the fact that population sizes differ,"" says Forthun. What lockdowns did affect, in part, was the timing of when spikes in excess deaths occurred. Of Norway's approach, Forthun adds: ""We probably kept some older and vulnerable people alive for a longer period."" Whereas authorities in Swedenwere criticised in 2020over high numbers of deaths at care homes.
Some economists have combined similar data with comparisons of economic performance indicators between the same four Nordic countries to argue that, overall,Sweden's approach was justifieddue to the relatively low economic costs. But such arguments are controversial and the lack of a lockdown in Sweden remains an area for heated debate among some.
Another study by a group of German economists – whomodelled how a lockdown could have affected pandemic outcomes in Sweden– suggests that the substantial voluntary restraints enacted by people in the country appear to have replicated some of the effects of a lockdown anyway.
One Swedish epidemiologist, Nele Brusselaers, of the Karolinska Institute, has criticised her country's Covid-19 strategy. She moved to Belgium during the pandemic.
""I'm a medical doctor so of course I care about lives,"" she says. ""We want to save every single life."" She says many of her fellow Swedes are ""still in denial"" about Covid-19 though some have come to question the lack of lockdown in recent years.
Brusselaers, who lived in Sweden in 2020, notes how her posts about Covid-19 on social media resulted in fierce pushback from some who disagreed with her stance on lockdown as an appropriate strategy. ""You get so much hatred,"" she says. ""That's not something I was used to.""
Even today, some people find it hard to move past the hostility they faced on the topic of lockdowns. One university researcher approached by the BBC for this article said they were so traumatised by the abuse they received online in 2020 that they never intended to comment on Covid-19 control measures, or lockdowns, publicly again.
Furthermore, some people who lived in countries without lockdowns, and who disagreed with their government's approach, are still reeling from the experience. Tanzania never had any Covid-19 lockdowns. The country's formerPresident, John Magufuli, who dismissed lockdowns and other public health interventions, diedin 2021. Magufuli's approach to the pandemic was ""unscientific"", says history lecturer Fadhili Mtani at the Muslim University of Morogoro in Tanzania. ""He advocated fortraditional herbsand later herejected vaccines."" (Read abouthow Covid-19 myths rapidly spread around the world.)
But Mtani recalls visiting hospitals where members of his own family had passed away of an illness. ""I saw people suffocating in the hospitals,"" he says. ""The hospital said we should not say it's Covid."" Official figures suggestaround 840 people have died of Covid-19 in Tanzaniasince the start of the pandemic. Mtani says that the government has not made accurate statistics available, however. An international collaboration aimed atestimating the global excess deathsduring the first two years of the pandemic has put the total number of deaths in Tanzania at somewhere between 102,000-188,000.
Mtani argues that Tanzania should have enforced a lockdown, though without placing excessive restrictions on the movement of workers. ""The majority of people are poor. To deny movement for them is to deny their existence,"" Mtani explains.
Many scientists emphasise that lockdowns were crucial for saving lives in the early part of the pandemic, before vaccines were available, and also for limiting the pressure on health services. By March 2020, this pressure was already severe in the UK, says Adam Kucharski, professor of infectious disease epidemiology, at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. ""The NHS was overwhelmed,"" Kucharski explains, referring to theemotional testimony of doctorswho have spoken to the UK's public inquiry into the government’s Covid-19 response. ""It's ridiculous to suggest [the NHS] wasn't under effectively breaking pressure by that point,"" adds Kucharski.
Kucharski also says that, because of the UK's global connections and the large number of young people who live togetheror with their parentscomparedto Sweden, for example, it might have been much harder for the UK to control Covid-19 transmission without imposing a lockdown.
He also points toa 2021 studythat attempted to quantify the effect of specific government interventions on the spread of Covid-19, using data from 41 countries. It reveals that certain aspects of national lockdowns might have been more impactful than others. The researchers found, for example, that banning gatherings of more than 10 people or closing schools and universities was especially effective, reducing transmission by more than 35% on average. Shutting restaurants and bars seemed to make slightly less difference to transmission, however.
What's more, the researchers suggest that adding a strict stay-at-home order on top of such measures ""only had a small additional effect"" in terms of slowing down Covid-19 – estimated at below 17.5% on average.
Countries that chose not to lock down severely may also have had more time to prepare for the arrival of Covid-19, or social and structural reasons as to why the Sars-CoV-2 virus was less likely to spread quickly there versus other nations. Even then, there are surprising comparisons to be made. Take Iceland and New Zealand, for instance. Both are wealthy island nations with relatively small populations but while New Zealand introduceda strict lockdown on 25 March 2020, Iceland never did.
""They [Iceland] had more of a mitigation strategy,"" says Leah Grout, a research data analyst specialising in public health at the Southern California University of Health Sciences. Grout waslead author on a research paperabout the contrasting Covid-19 strategies and outcomes of these two countries. Iceland introduceda test and trace programme, in which infections and contacts between people were monitored so that individuals – rather than entire populations – were asked to observe quarantine for a time. This measure was also used in many countries that also applied lockdowns, when those lockdowns were lifted. Iceland had some restrictions on social gatherings and it didclose its borders to some travellers, briefly.
""New Zealand had one of the lowest mortality rates globally with their approach,"" says Grout. ""Iceland also fared pretty well."" Plus, the economic impacts on both countries were limited, she adds. Other researchers have made similar findingsregarding New ZealandandIceland.
More like this:
Much was written in 2020 about various countries' efforts to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. But, in retrospect, that seems much too early to come to any real conclusions.Uruguay was lauded at the timefor apparently managing to keep Covid-19 at bay, despite never enacting a strict lockdown. The country's government enforced some forms of social distancing, including the closure of some gyms, and Uruguay's borders were alsoclosed to certain travellers, for instance. But ports remained open and there was no stay-at-home order affecting the entire population.
A study published in 2024 found that, while excess deaths were low in Uruguay during 2020, they actually rose substantially in 2021 and 2022. Excess deaths in 2021, for example, were nearly 19% above the expected figure, based on historical trends. The study's authors put this down mostly to the spread of Covid-19 but add that impacts from the pandemic on the ability to provide healthcare in other ways probably also played a role.
Similarly, Japan was able to keep mortality from Covid-19 to a relatively low level in the early part of the pandemic. By the summer of 2022, Covid-19deaths had reached 36,200. Today, they standat 130,000.
So, what happened in the interim? The Omicron variant. New, mutated forms of the early Sars-CoV-2 virus thatspread worldwide in 2022 and 2023. (Find out more abouthow Covid-19's symptoms have changed as new variants of the virus have emergedin this article by David Cox.)
Some researchers argue that Japan’s approach proved to be the right one overall. ""Even without lockdown, suppression of epidemic curves has been largely successful,"" argues Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor in the graduate school of medicine at Kyoto University.
However, as in other countries where legally binding lockdowns did not come into force, there is evidence that people in Japanchanged their behaviour significantly anyway. One study of people's movements based onmobile phone data suggests that, when the Japanese governmentdeclared a nationwide state of emergency in April 2020, people in Tokyo reduced their outings from home roughly as much as people in the US who, conversely,faced legally binding lockdowns.
Despite this, Yasuharu Tokuda, a clinical epidemiologist and director of the Muribushi Okinawa Center for Teaching Hospitals in Okinawa, Japan, argues that a tougher approach might have been beneficial. ""Some patients could not be admitted to the hospital because of the lack of available beds,"" he says. ""If we have a strong viral pandemic, then we need to have a stricter lockdown in Japan."" Research suggests thatthere might be resistance to such an ideaamong members of the public in Japan, however.
It is important to reflect on just how drastic a measure lockdown really is. Kucharski, for one, calls it a ""blunt"" tool. ""We should never have got to that point where we were in so much trouble, with so little visibility of what the pandemic was doing,"" he says. It was due to a lack of certainty over what would happen next, and a dearth of other interventions on the table, that the UK was more or less forced into lockdown, he suggests.
Many have still not got over the effects of lockdown. In March 2020, Bill Allison, a former civil servant in Scotland, was in his mid-60s. He had many plans for his retirement – he wanted to see the world. Back then, Allison was also an avid pub-goer who frequently met up with his friends for a pint. Lockdown stopped him in his tracks. He says he followed the rules at all times but this left him feeling a profound sense of loneliness and isolation.
""I gathered up all the scraps of wood that I had and decided to see if I could make them into an electric guitar,"" he says. ""I would work late at night. There was nothing else to do, really."" He found a guitar-making group online, through which he met people with similar interests. ""I made quite a lot of new friends.""
But when the world gradually began to open up again, Allison was struck by a strong sense of what he had been missing and was hard to regain.
""The pub near me, it's nothing like as busy as it was before Covid,"" he says. ""I became quite introverted and now I find I don't want to interact with people as much as I did before. I was discussing it with a few of my friends. […] We all feel very unhappy.""
Soon to turn 72, Allison says his pre-pandemic travel plans remain on hold. ""I'm kind of getting to the age where I don't really want to do a nine-hour flight to the other side of the world anymore. It's kind of knocked me back.""
Countless studies show thatsocial isolationand loneliness affected thousands of people during the pandemic, and that this was a particularly acute problemduring national lockdowns. There were negativeimpacts on single parents, also, who found it harder to earn an income while looking after their children. There were also concerns that thesudden loss of social interactionand access to educationeffected the development of young children, with some evidencepointing to an impact on their language skills. More thanone billion children and studentsfound themselves shut off from their usual methods of learning. Recently published research using data from 72 countries suggests that the closure of schools during the pandemic may have led to a decline inmathematics scores by an average of 14%– equivalent to seven months of learning.
In countries including the UK, lockdown was associated witha rise in domestic abuse. And, what's more, lockdowns had a huge impact on access to healthcare. Many people found theircancer screenings and treatmentswere cancelled or delayed, for example.
As for potential benefits of lockdowns not related to Covid-19 transmission, much was made oftemporary reductions in airpollution andcarbon emissionsas a result of therestrictions imposedduring theearly stages of the pandemic. These turned out to be atemporary blipas greenhouse gas emissions resurged and air quality dipped once people emerged from their confinement.
Authorities in some countries that attempted to enforce strict lockdowns and a ""zero Covid"" policy were greeted with violent protests from members of the public. Some widely publicised cases of this emerged inChina during 2022.
There is no getting away from the fact that a sweeping stay-at-home order is an extreme intervention, and one that comes with heaps of negative consequences. Governments in 2020 had to weigh up whether they could successfully enforce such a measure, and whether it was really worth it.
Unless, of course, they had an alternative. The government in Taiwan, for example, never imposed a lockdown and instead relied onnear-universal mask-wearing, border restrictions and intensive contact tracing, which involved access to lots of personal data. This included commuters'smart card informationandmobile phone location data. Some of this monitoring was exhaustive.
""[Taiwan Centers for Disease Control] also set up a smartphone-based real-time locating system to track contacts' phone signals and alert local authorities if anyone left their designated location or switched off their phone. Authorities would contact or visit those who triggered an alert within 15 minutes in person,""one paper notes.
Essentially, Taiwan (and later South Korea, which to some extentmirrored Taiwan's approach) avoided lockdown through fine-grained monitoring and control of an entire population. Even in Taiwan, however,Covid-19 outbreakscaused problems. Initially, in thefirst half of 2021and then again in 2022,cases surgedas somepreventative measures in the country, and the population itself,started to relax. Researchers note, though, that Covid-19 deaths became less common over time,as Taiwan's health authorities rolled out vaccines to the population.
While these case studies of various countries show that it was clearly possible to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic without resorting to national lockdowns, the end results seem to depend on the attributes of specific countries, their populations, and their healthcare systems. Ultimately, the vast majority of nations did enact lockdowns at some point during 2020 or 2021 and it would be hard to suggest that they are all significantly worse off because of that intervention, specifically.
Still, five years later, the harshness of lockdowns and their effects on millions if not billions of people has become clearer. Even some researchers who have found evidence that lockdowns saved lives havecautioned against turning to this measure in hastein the future. The longer-term effects onchildren, education and economiesare still playing out and will likely not be fully understood for many years to come.
Whatever governments decide to do, having a plan that they communicate in advance of any new pandemic will likely improve public acceptance of and adherence to any strict mitigations, says Grout. ""It needs to be super clear."" That means everyone could know ahead of time what circumstances would trigger a lockdown.
In Gothenburg, Mc Manus remembers the debates she once had with her fellow Swedes over whether her country was doing the right thing in 2020. And how some people seemed cavalier or uninterested in observing social distancing guidelines at the time.
""You don't even talk about it anymore,"" she says, ""Thinking back, I feel like, as a society, did we really learn anything from this?""

The bizarre quantum paradox of 'negative time',"In the quantum world, our intuitive grasp of past, present and future may not apply. Richard Fisher explores the discombobulating concepts of ""negative time"" and ""retrocausality"".
Tony Soprano is smoking a cigar, driving home. His journey begins in Manhattan, where he enters the Lincoln Tunnel, headed towards New Jersey. There's no traffic, so he passes through in a few minutes, emerging into the daylight.
So begins the familiar opening credits ofThe SopranosTV show.
In the physical world of mafia bosses, one event follows another. So if Tony strikes a match to light his cigar, this needs to happen before the tip ignites. Such causality appears to be fundamental to how we experience the Universe.
However, at the quantum level, temporal sequencing is not so clear or intuitive. In recent years, physicists have been exploring some seriously head-scratching behaviours at very small scales – some of which can be explained; some of which seem to throw our understanding of past, present and future into question.
To get a flavour, imagine The Sopranos opening credits featured an FBI helicopter watching Tony emerge from the Lincoln Tunnel – but they can't make sense of what they're seeing. From their perspective, the mafia boss leaves the tunnel before he enters. And when the confused FBI officers check their watches, he has spent anegativeamount of time driving between Manhattan and New Jersey.
That of course is impossible. However, recently physicists were in the headlines for measuring a duration of""negative time"". In quantum experiments, they sent light-pulses through the equivalent of a tunnel – but like Tony Soprano's puzzling drive, the pulses apparently spent less than zero time travelling through.
And that's not the only baffling example of temporal strangeness at very small scales – other theorists think it's conceivable that some particles could even change the past from the future, via an effect called ""retrocausality"". In the quantum world, it seems our familiar understanding of time quickly becomes, well, disordered.
This year will mark 100 years since the development of quantum mechanics, and the UN has designated 2025 as theInternational Year of Quantum Science and Technology. Over the past century, physicists have explored all sorts of unusual behaviours in the quantum world:entanglement,superposition,uncertaintyand more.
One of the lesser-known examples is a puzzling way that light tunnels through barriers, such as clouds of atoms. In the 1990s, physicists fired photons through a barrier as a ""wave packet"" (a bundle of waves that describes both the particle and wave nature of light). Puzzlingly, the packet's peakapparently emerged before they entered– like a car leaving a tunnel before it drove in.
Earlier theory in the mid-20th Century hadpredicted the effect– now known as a ""negative group delay"" – but observing it experimentally was another thing, because it should be impossible. It suggested that light could travel faster than itself, which is nonsensical. Moreover, events in time were apparently occurring out of order.
""We had to find a new way to reconcile that with our ideas of causality,"" says physicist Aephraim Steinberg of the University of Toronto.
In the intervening years, Steinberg and his fellow physicists proposed what could be happening, without violating known physical laws. In short, they argued that the wave packet was not time-travelling but reorganising itself to give theappearanceof effect coming before cause.
To understand, imagine a line of cars driving between New York and New Jersey, says Steinberg. We might picture them as 100 Tony Sopranos, each driving bumper-to-bumper. These represent photons in a wave packet.
The line of Tonys depart Manhattan at 13.00. At around 13.30, the midpoint of this car-train enters the Lincoln Tunnel. This is the peak of a wave packet. You would expect this peak to emerge a few minutes later, right? However, the peak has already left the tunnel – at 13.25. Tony Soprano, apparent time-traveller.
What may actually be happening at the quantum level, inside the barrier, is that not all the photons are making it through, says Steinberg. In the car analogy, some Tonys are getting pulled over or turned back; in the experiment, they are absorbed or ejected by atoms within the barrier. When this happens, the forward tail of the wave packet reshapes itself into a new peak. It looks uncannily like the one entering.
Naturally, it's more complex than that – photons don't act like queuing cars because their position is undetermined. ""The photons don't have any individual identity,"" says Steinberg. ""That's why the tunnel is purely an analogy, but it's meant to show that there's no contradiction with causality."" So what appears to be a violation of physical laws ismore like a reorganisation within the light-pulse. With this explanation, no particle is experiencing negative time and there's no faster-than-light travel.
Mystery solved? Not quite.
More recent experiments from Steinberg's group have added a new twist and can't be explained (yet). Whereas physicists in the earlier work were observing an apparent negativedelay– a pulse leaving a barrier before it entered – this time, a team led by physicist Daniela Angulo Murcillo calculateda negativeduration.
Delay and duration sound like they should be the same: after all, if your flight has a delay, that's the same as the duration you spend waiting. But that doesn't appear to be the case at atomic scales. ""It turns out quantum mechanics says there might be one process – one event – that's described by multiple time scales,"" says Steinberg. ""So you might ask, 'when does [a photon] arrive?' You might ask, 'how long does it spend in the barrier?' You're not necessarily going to get the same answer.""
A negative measurement of duration has added a new level of strangeness. In the car analogy, Tony Soprano is spending less than zero amount of time in the tunnel, and it can't be explained by the same wave packet reshuffling that explained the negative delay.
""When the weirdness was explored in the 1990s, people made sense of it. But looking again, a little deeper, the mystery appears to be kind of irrepressible now. There's something here that is truly, seemingly paradoxical,"" says Josiah Sinclair, now at MIT, who worked with Steinberg and colleagues in recent yearsto explore this phenomenon.
It began with a seemingly simple question:how long dophotons spend tunnelling through a barrier? Making this measurement is not as easy as setting a stopwatch. Unlike cars in a tunnel, photons have no fixed position or trajectory through space. ""An incredibly fundamental and deep insight about the nature of photons is that they don't have the same reality,"" says Sinclair. ""Their existence is fundamentally different to cars. We can't label and track them.""
So, the physicists measured the spent time indirectly, by analysing theexcitation of atomswithin the barrier, as photons pass through or strike them. To return to the car-tunnel analogy, Sinclair says it's a bit like analysing passing vehicles using only their emissions. If you installed a carbon monoxide monitor inside the Lincoln Tunnel, you couldn't track individual cars but you could maybe figure out how long the passing vehicles spent in there.
""The shocking thing is that when you design something that measures how long are the cars in the tunnel – this carbon monoxide monitor – it turns out that the monitor in this kind of quantum mechanical situation will read negative minutes,"" says Sinclair.
""We understand mathematically why it's happening, but we don't know how to talk about the physical meaning of it,"" he continues. ""There's no clear correspondence to the world that we know: the physical world we experience. And so we're just left saying, 'Okay, well, I guess quantum mechanics are just different'.""
If you think that is strange though, quantum mechanics has even more bewilderment in store. In recent years, some theorists have proposed thatparticles may be able to change the past from the future– so-called ""retrocausality"".
While this idea doesn't have the observational evidence of the quantum tunnel experiments, it's a prospect taken seriously by physicists. The reason is that such temporal weirdness would help to solve an apparent impossibilitytheyhaveobserved, dubbed ""spooky action at a distance"".
This spooky action happens whentwo particles are ""entangled"", which means they are strongly connected, regardless of how far apart they are physically. In principle, they could be at opposite sides of the Universe, but when scientists measure, say, the spin or polarisation of one entangled particle, a corresponding property of its entangled partner becomes instantly determined.
To return to The Sopranos, it's a bit like if Tony had a twin brother who lived in California. If Tony orders veal at Vesuvio's restaurant in New Jersey, his brother's order at a Los Angeles restaurant instantly becomes veal too (or perhaps fish; the property needn't be identical, but the key point is that the brother's meal is not determined until that moment).
What makes it spooky is that particles don't have these properties until they are measured; until then, they exist in multiple states simultaneously. In the Soprano twin analogy, there's no pre-planning about their meal choices; it's as if some influence is passing instantaneously between them as the waiter takes Tony's order, faster than light.
""It's possible to show mathematically that those correlations are not explainable in terms of a common cause in the past,"" says physicist Emily Adlam at Chapman University in California. ""It looks naively as though there's some kind of instantaneous signal going from one particle to the other telling this particle what measurement you performed, or vice versa. That's pretty weird. Physicists don't think that signals should be able to send faster than light.""
One way to get round the spooky-action-at-a-distance problem – also known as non-locality – is to invoke retrocausality. In this scenario, information does not need to pass instantaneously between the particles across space; it happens acrosstime.
If true, it would mean that a measured particle passes information into the past – to the moment it was entangled with its pair – and then forwards to the moment at which the measurement happens. Or in the Sopranos analogy, Tony's meal order in New Jersey goes back to when the two twins were in the womb, and then forwards to the California restaurant.
More like this:
•Why does time go forward, not backward?
•Is time travel really possible? Here's what physics says
•Time: The Ultimate Guide
This is admittedly a counterintuitive concept to get your head around, and it seemingly replaces one impossibility with another – a cure that seems worse than the disease. And that's not to mention the fact that it would seem to open the door toparadoxes of time travel, where influencing the past alters the present. However, it wouldn't be the first time quantum mechanics has defied common sense.
In its defence,retrocausality's supportershave pointed out that it only seems unlikely because we – at the macroscopic scale – experience time in one direction. At very small scales, it's long been believed that the physical laws aretime-symmetric(withsome exceptions). And as for the apparent time-travel problem, that only appliesif the particle was measuredin the past, they say. That doesn't happen; instead, it stays in its quantum underdetermined state.
Still, if it's true, the Universe would have to work differently than we currently imagine, says Adlam. In one scenario, two timelines would essentially sit side-by-side. ""When people mention retrocausality, what they seem to have in mind is a picture in which there's a forward evolution and a backwards evolution of the Universe. It's a picture with two separate and independent causal arrows,"" she says. ""That's a kind of 'dynamical' picture of retrocausality, where you have literal forwards and backwards processes happening in some combination.""
Adlam, however, doubts this scenario. ""It is not a very appealing way of thinking about retrocausality, because you can very easily get inconsistencies, contradictions and paradoxes,"" she says.
Instead, she argues that retrocausality is more plausible if we live in what's known as a ""block universe"". This is a hypothetical (and philosophically controversial) model of existence, where all moments in time – past, present, and future – exist in a four-dimensional object.
If this block is filled with every event that ever has or will happen, then it's easier to see how some hypothetical influence could pass between particles within it, says Adlam. To explain the spooky actions of entangled particles, information would not need to travel backward on some alternative retrocausal timeline. ""There's no temporal flow,"" she says. ""Time is just another dimension within the block, rather than being a material thing that moves.""
If that is the case, we have arrived at what may be the most troubling implication of all about quantum mechanics and its weird temporal behaviour. If you accept themost fatalistic interpretation of the block universe, then, like Tony Soprano, we're all just characters in some cosmic TV series. We may experience life episodically, but our future is just as determined as our past. So while you're currently in the middle of your story, here's a spoiler alert: your own finale – the moment where the scenecuts to black– may already be written.

Lunar eclipse to grace pre-dawn sky,"Early-rising UK stargazers are in for a celestial treat later this week as a partial lunar eclipse takes place just before dawn on Friday.
Earth will cast its shadow over the Moon. Unlike in other parts of the world, the eclipse in the UK will only be partial but still a dramatic spectacle, weather permitting.
As the Moon moves into Earth's shadow, it will gradually darken before turning a dusky red, resulting in a stunning ""blood moon"".
The last total lunar eclipse in the UK occurred in 2022.
The penumbral phase (when the Moon first enters Earth's outer shadow) will begin at 03:57 on Friday.
The partial eclipse - when the Moon starts moving into the darker part of Earth's shadow - will begin at 05:09.
Lunar eclipses are visible from anywhere on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon at the time.
At 06:58 the eclipse will reach its true maximum; however, in the UK, the Moon will have already set below the horizon, so we won't be able to see this.
For those in North America, most of South America, and western Greenland, the eclipse will be total.
""Even if you have to get up super early to see it, I would definitely recommend that you try because seeing it in real life is really, really cool,"" says Imo Bell, astronomer at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.
A lunar eclipse happens when Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight and casting a shadow on the Moon's surface.
There are three main types:
People sometimes refer to a lunar eclipse as a ""blood moon"" because of the way the Moon can turn a deep, coppery red during the eclipse.
This is caused by a process known as ""Rayleigh scattering"" which also makes the sky blue and our sunsets red. It scatters more of the shorter blue wavelength light, allowing the longer red wavelength light to remain visible.
During a lunar eclipse, all of the light shining onto the Moon has come through Earth's atmosphere. It's as if every sunrise and sunset in the world is projected onto the lunar surface.
To get the best view of the eclipse, head to a clear, dark location.
""My top tip would be to make sure you have a good view of the western horizon, because the Moon will be in the west and it will be setting towards the western horizon,"" advises Imo Bell of the Royal Observatory.
Another top tip from Imo: it'll be dark so bring a light to help get around, but use a red torch if you can get hold of one. It helps keep your eyes adjusted to the dark.
Also, of course, check the weather forecast.
""Even though some people might say it's not that unusual to get a lunar eclipse, as we can see one every few years, next time it comes around, it might be cloudy. So, if you can, definitely do get out and try and have a look,"" said Imo.
The next lunar eclipse visible in the UK will be on 7 September 2025.

"'Garbage' to blame Ukraine for massive X outage, experts say","Experts have cast doubt on Elon Musk's claim that a large-scale outage which hit X was caused by hackers in Ukraine.
Platform monitor Downdetector says it had more than 1.6 million reports of problems with the social media site from users around the world on Monday.
""We're not sure exactly what happened but there was a massive cyber-attack to try and bring down the X system with IP [Internet Protocol] addresses originating in the Ukraine area,"" Musk said in an interview with the Fox Business channel.
However, Ciaran Martin, professor at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government told the BBC that explanation was ""wholly unconvincing"" and ""pretty much garbage.""
Prof Martin - former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre - says it looks as if X was targeted by what's known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, where hackers flood a server with internet traffic to prevent users from connecting to a website.
""It's not that sophisticated - it's a very old technique,"" Mr Martin told Radio 4's Today programme.
""I can't think of a company of the size and standing internationally of X that's fallen over to a DDoS attack for a very long time,"" he added.
He said the incident at X ""doesn't reflect well on their cyber security.""
Many users trying to access the platform and refresh feeds on its app and desktop site during Monday's outages were met with a loading icon.
Musk, who has been a frequent critic of Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelensky, has offered no evidence to support his claim and did not say whether or not he thought state actors were involved.
He posted on X that ""either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved"".
But Prof Martin said tracing IP addresses ""tells you absolutely nothing,"" because hackers in this situation would hijack devices from all over the world.
The BBC has approached the Ukrainian embassy in Washington DC for comment.
Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, which monitors the connectivity of web services, said its own metrics suggested the outages could well be linked to a cyber attack.
""What we've been seeing is consistent with what we've seen in past denial of service attacks, rather than a configuration or coding error in the platform,"" he told the BBC.
He said the organisation has seen several major outages spanning more than six hours on Monday, ""each having global impact"".
""This is amongst the longest X/Twitter outages we've tracked in terms of duration, and the pattern is consistent with a denial of service attack targeting X's infrastructure at scale,"" he added.
Musk has previously claimed that the platform has been targeted by DDoS attacks,but these have not been confirmed.
Like all major social networks, X is a regular target for disruptive and attention seeking attacks.
But X has a track record of falling due to these attacks much more than other larger sites like Facebook and Instagram.
In 2023, a small group of hackers called Anonymous Sudantook the site offlinein more than a dozen countries for hours in an attempt to pressurise Elon Musk into launching his Starlink service in their country.
Two men were arrestedin 2024 for being the ringleaders of the group - showing that hackers can disrupt X with DDoS attacks from anywhere in the world with the right tools and expertise.
Cyber specialists are seeing a ""sharp rise"" in DDoS attacks which are becoming ""an increasingly popular tool"" for criminals, according to Sian John, chief technology officer at cyber security company NCC Group.
""Businesses that store large amounts of sensitive data, like tech firms, financial institutions, and healthcare providers, are frequent targets,"" she said.
""But any organisation with an online presence is at risk.""

Can you solve these time puzzles from the ancient world?,"As the clocks go forward this spring, see if you can solve these puzzles based on ancient calendars.
When the clocks change for Daylight Saving Time, it can often involve a bit more mental arithmetic than usual as we try to figure out our schedules. This is especially true for those of us trying to navigate different time zones.
For most of the US, the clocks go forward one hour on thesecond Sunday in March– unless you're in Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe Daylight Saving Time. Spare a thought for the Navajo Nation living in Arizona – theymove to daylight savings timeeven though the rest of the state stays on standard time.
And for those making transatlantic calls, the time difference is a little shorter for the next three weeks as theUKand the rest of Europe do not move to their summer time schedule until later in March. But even here there can be mental agility needed - the clocks at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London, are a frequent cause of confusion for visitors as theyremain on GMT throughout the summer.
In the ancient world, there were far more radical changes to the way people observed and formalised time. The changes to the calendars used by the Romans, for instance, led to seemingly impossible conundrums.
To help limber up your brain for the weeks ahead, we've put together the following time-based riddles with the advice of Helen Parish, professor of history at the University of Reading in the UK. Scroll to the bottom of the article for the answers – or if you'd like a clue,get some hints in this story first.
Puzzle 1: The impossible letter
A woman sits down to write a letter in France on 8 November 1582.
Three days earlier, the letter is received in England.
What happened?
Puzzle 2: The mystery of the missing birthdays
In the year 46BC, in Rome, a child is born in spring.
She lives to be 60 years old, though she never has another birthday again.
But why?
Puzzle 3: The strangely ageing farmhand
After working in the fields on the last day of December 800BC, a farm labourer downs his tools and goes to bed.
On the first day of the new year, when he picks up his tools to start work again, he is two months older.
How can this be?
The impossible letter – Puzzle 1
In the 1500s, the old Julian calendar was replaced by the Gregorian calendar. But different countries in Europe adopted the new calendar at different times – which meant the days across the continent were often out of sync, leaving some countries several days or weeks behind others.
The mystery of the missing birthdays – Puzzle 2
Romans used to use extra months known as ""intercalary months"", which were added ad hoc to realign the 355-day Roman year with the solar year. The child in question was born in the intercalary month of Mercedonius. The last time the month of Mercedonius was used was spring 46BC, so the child was severely short-changed on birthdays.
The strangely ageing farmhand – Puzzle 3
The pre-Julian calendar only had 10 months, and didn't calendarise the roughly 60 days of wintertime when there was no agricultural work to be done. During this wintertime, there was no real concept of ""months"".
Bonus:
Even in our modern world there are calendar quirks that mean some people live in multiple time zones where they can be several different ages at once. With a bit of border-hopping, it is also possible to travel back to the 1300s or forward to the 26th Century.

Software bug at firm left NHS data 'vulnerable to hackers',"The NHS is ""looking into"" allegations that patient data was left vulnerable to hacking due to a software flaw at a private medical services company.
The flaw was found last November at Medefer, which handles 1,500 NHS patient referrals a month in England.
The software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years.
Medefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised.
The flaw was fixed a few days after being discovered.
In late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems.
An NHS spokesperson said: ""We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate.""
Medefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data.
However, the software bug, discovered in November, made Medefer's internal patient record system vulnerable to hackers, the engineer said.
The software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered.
""When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'.""
The problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other.
The engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information.
He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.
""I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,"" he said.
On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be brought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.
Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.
It says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was ""extremely open"".
Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), ""in the interests of transparency"", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.
The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.
In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: ""There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.""
He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.
""The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.""
The security agency will complete its review later this week.
Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: ""We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.""

Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.
""There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.
""The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,"" he added.
Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have brought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.
""Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,"" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.
Medefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across England.
In a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector.
""Individual NHS organisations must ensure they meet their legal responsibilities and national data security standards to protect patient data when appointing suppliers, and we offer them support and training nationally on how this should be done.""

A virtual reality pangolin made me cry and care more about the planet: Is this the real power of VR headsets?,"For many, constant bad news numbs our reaction to climate disasters. But research suggests that a new type of immersive storytelling about nature told through virtual reality (VR) can both build empathy and inspire us to act.
I'm crying into a VR headset. I've just watched a VR experience that tells the story of a young pangolin called Chestnut, as she struggles to survive in the Kalahari Desert. A vast, dusty landscape extends around me in all directions, and her armoured body seems vulnerable as she curls up, alone, to sleep. Her story is based on the life of a real pangolin that was tracked by scientists.
Chestnut hasn't found enough to ants to eat, since insect numbers have dwindled due to climate change. Her sunny voice remains optimistic even as exhaustion takes over. In the final scenes, she dies, and I must clumsily lift my headset to dab my eyes.
VR experiences can be a lot more than just moving or fun, research suggests. Scientists are discovering that nature experiences shown through VR can affect our attitudes and behaviours – and that these arresting depictions of nature might nudge us into taking better care of our environment.
My powerful VR experience with Chestnut's story was made by HabitatXR, a production studio based in Johannesburg. Founder Ulrico Grech-Cumbo launched the company in 2016, following many trips to the African bush during which he captured its green, dusty landscapes and iconic wildlife on camera. He had experience working in VR, and realised that he could translate his footage into something more immersive.
""I thought it would be a hell of a lot of fun being inside a natural history documentary,"" he says.
HabitatXR is just one of the companies experimenting with VR technology to create nature experiences.Wild Immersion, based in Paris, take their immersive movies of underwater worlds and snowscapes to science centres and aquariums. And UK artist collectiveMarshmallow Laser Feasthave created immersive experiences that show the forest through the eyes of a dragonfly, and take the viewer ""inside"" a tree.
The nature experiences developed by HabitatXR are situated in a virtual version of the African savannah. In one, I find myself in a misty landscape dotted with squat, flat-topped acacias. Suddenly a rhinoceros emerges, dangerously close, its enormous horn scything the air as it walks towards me and lowers its head.
Despite the pixelated graphics, I instinctively look down to where my knee should be – to where the rhino's horn ought to have grazed it. The beast lets out a breathy snort and, mercifully, retreats.
I'm beginning to see how emotionally compelling this kind of storytelling can be. And I'm not alone – when an environmental NGO took one of HabitatXR's VR experiences to a fundraising gala, Grech-Cumbo saw the powerful effect it had on those who watched it. ""High net worth individuals were strolling around with expensive watches and glasses of champagne,"" he says. ""We'd sit them down in a dark room and put a VR headset on them, and five minutes later, they'd be crying. That's not something I've ever seen a film do [to] 50 people at a time.""
Grech-Cumbo's observation is reflected in scientific research, which finds that VR tends to trigger stronger emotions than other media. Engaging in a VR experience about a Syrian refugee elicitsmore intense emotionsthan reading an article showing the same images and information, for example.
There may be particular benefits to VR content that deals with nature. One nature experience depicting a forest of majestic trees, for example, made peoplemore likely to take actionto protect the environment, such as signing a petition on plastic reduction or taking flyers to spread the word about the petition. Another, of a journey through the Amazon rainforest, found that participants who experienced the forest through VR reported feeling more connected to nature and expressed greatercommitment to the environmentthan participants who watched the same rainforest visuals on a standard computer screen.
VR isparticularly goodat making us feel a complex and impactful emotion: awe.Psychologists describe aweas the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends your current understanding of the world. It can make us feelwonder, but also uncertainty. And research suggests that experiencing awe can make us more inclined tomake personal sacrifices for the environment.
These recent scientific analyses of awe build on a long history of its exploration in philosophy and the arts. It particularly obsessed certain 18th-Century poets and writers, whose experience of what they called ""the sublime"" was often inspired by nature. (Learn more about the power of awe in this article by Richard Fisher about the upsides of feeling small.)
Alice Chirico, a psychologist at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, Italy, has studied VR's ability to make us feel awe, and how this might impact people's relationship to the natural world. She has found that VR nature experiences prompt us to feel awe when they induce a sense of vastness – likehuge mountains and tall trees. In another study, she found that these kinds of awe-inspiring virtual nature experiences made people more likely totake social actions geared towards protectingthe environment

In another study, she found that these kinds of awe-inspiring virtual nature experiences made people more likely totakesocial actions geared towards protectingthe environment.
""Awe is able to support positive attitudes towards the environment and also a sense of attachment towards the environment – a kind of nature connectedness, the feeling of being included within something that is much bigger than us,"" Chirico says.
VR can do this in ways that other media formats can't, she says, because it can drop us into a story and create the illusion that we're part of it. VR ""manipulates the sense of presence"", Chirico says, creating ""the illusion of being really there in that specific place in that specific moment, as if it is reality itself"".
The immersive advantage VR may have over other media such as articles or videos could have real world impacts. Researchers have found that people aremore inclined to save energy at homewhen they learn about the need for pro-environmental behaviours through VR, rather than from an article or video. They suggest that the difference is because of what they call the ""presence mechanism"" – the feeling of truly being inanother world.
These experiences typically bring the viewer up close to their subject – face to face with a gorilla, or inside a migrating wildebeest herd. Feelings of immersion in such scenes might be limited by current technology, however. For me, the horn-swinging rhino was striking, though not visually believable. Researchers suggest thatrich, high resolution imageryis important for immersing the viewer in the experience. VR tech likely to improve in the coming years, as accessories heighten the realism of virtual worlds. There is even aglove able to convince its wearerthat a spider is crawling across their hand, for example.
Despite decades of excitement over VR, the technology has struggled to break into the mainstream. Even today, relatively few people have access to VR headsets, with only around10 millionof the devices sold across the globe every year. Reports suggest that Apple's long-awaited Vision Pro headset, for example – which costs $3,499 in the US and £3,499 in the UK – has achieveda fraction of its expected sales.
""Even though I've been working in this world for 10 years, there's probably a nine out of 10 chance that if I put a headset on a person, it's their first time wearing a VR headset,"" Grech-Cumbo says.
Even if the technology were more accessible, could dazzling virtual experiences undermine our appreciation for local, everyday nature? It is important, Grech-Cumbo acknowledges, that eye-catching VR nature experiences don't distract us from the real forests, parks and mountain ranges near to where we live.
""This is about understanding our own relationship with nature, wherever we are,"" he says.
With this in mind, HabitatXR is now working on a project that will bring virtual nature into cities, starting with Johannesburg. Their plans for a VR ""Zoo of the Future"" will include a web of life experience, in which people will be able to virtually pick up individual species – flowers, grasses, bugs, animals – from an ecosystem map, and see their ecological links to other species.
""[We want to] put an emphasis on the fact that we are all connected – whether we believe it or not, whether we like it or not,"" Grech-Cumbo says.
Chirico emphasises that VR's goal should not be to replace reality and nature. There are lots of things virtual nature can't do. Studies suggest itcan't boost our moodin the same way real nature can, for instance. However, it could be democratising. ""People don't [always] have full or easy access to nature, so the goal is to provide it in a cheaper way,"" Chirico says.
More like this:
•The cement that could turn your house into a giant battery
•In Cleveland, mushrooms digest entire houses
•How beer sludge is being turned into vegan milk
In the US, for example,100 million people, including 28 million children, reportedly do not have access to parks close to their homes. VR nature experiences might, in such cases, enable people to interact with an unreal yet informative and inspiring version of nature. Plus, adds Chirico, ""There's the fact that you don't have to move from your home, so the emissions are reduced – you can explore amazing panoramas that otherwise would require hours and hours of traveling by plane or car.""
As I blinked through tears towards the end of HabitatXR's story about Chestnut the pangolin, some white text floated in front of me before the credits rolled: ""This isn't a story about pangolins. Or ants. Or even climate change. This is a story about us,"" it read – a reminder that humans are part of the same ecosystems as plants and other animals.
""The overarching message,"" Grech-Cumbo says, ""is that we are a part of nature, not the opposite of nature.""

Can LED face masks transform your skin - here's what the experts say,"LED technology has been usedto address a number of skin issues, such as eczema, mild to moderate acne, psoriasis and sun damage in a medical setting.
But the at-home LED market is on the verge of becoming a massive industry - with masks and other devices retailing for anything from £40 to £1,500.
The technology harnesses the power of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which then stimulate skin cells when they are exposed to the skin repeatedly.
Mask developers make big claims that at-home LED masks can be used to treat acne scars, sun damage and fine lines - but does this stand up to scrutiny?
The LED market is set to be worth£600m globally by 2032- which is nearly double what airflow technology like the Dyson Airwrap will beworth at the same point.
According to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM).
""This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin,"" he tells the BBC.
""PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin,"" he adds.
Arecent comprehensive studyof PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works.
US space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration.
Since then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists ""for many years"", according to Dr Kentley.
But at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.
The main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skin's surface when being used.
Dr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks ""sound promising"", mask wholesale manufacturers are ""speculating"" about their benefits.
""I don't believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital,"" she tells the BBC.
""No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident.
""So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest,"" she adds.
Skincare makes upnearly half of all global sales in the beauty industry- and is set to continue to grow more than the likes of haircare, make-up and fragrance in the next year.
This is being boosted by Generation Z (those born between 1995 and 2009) and even Generation Alpha (born 2010 to now) whose skincare fascination is said to befuelled by social media trends.
Dr Kluk says she has noticed ""that people's interest in at-home skin care and treatments has increased hugely since Covid"" and believes the ""visually interesting"" element of the at-home LED mask makes it such an eye-catching product to sell online.
""People sitting watching TV wearing a red LED mask increases people's curiosity.
""Every other consultation I've had for the last six months, has involved people asking me about LED masks,"" she adds.
When you search LED masks on social media platforms such as TikTok, you will be met with hundreds of videos with users showing off their results after using one of these at-home devices.
Natalie O'Neill, 29, tells the BBC she started to use a mask ""out of curiosity to see if I would notice any difference"" and did not use it to treat an existing skin condition like acne.
The skincare content creator says:  ""I noticed a change in my skin after a couple of weeks and felt it prevented breakouts really well.""
She adds that the mask has helped to ""keep my skin tone looking more even"" and faded marks on her face more quickly.
O'Neill was not paid to promote a particular mask and caveats all her content on this technology by saying she uses it alongside a consistent skincare routine.
""Getting red light or LED therapy in a clinic is not immediately transferable to a mask, which a lot of consumers don't realise - I'm OK with that because I have the right expectations,"" she adds.
Part of the appeal of LED masks is that they are easy to use and therefore have a low barrier to entry for potential buyers.
Laurence Newman is the chief executive of CurrentBody, whose at-home LED mask is one of the world's best sellers.
He started selling professional equipment to clinics more than 25 years ago and began developing an at-home LED mask in 2009, bringing out the company's first device just under 10 years later.
""We see that people use it for 10 minutes and get an instant glow afterwards,"" he tells the BBC.
Newman says that women in particular ""are moving towards totally non-invasive skincare"" and looking for ways to improve their skin without botox and fillers.
Newman says the masks his company sells have been developed using the same technology as medical devices, which have a minimum requirement light wavelengths.
He emphasises that the at-home LED mask market and indeed at-home beauty technology market are in their infancy, with ""a real movement of education"" growing.
Dr Kentley concludes that ""PBM is mostly considered safe, even at high levels"" so using any form of LED technology is unlikely to ""cause damage to cells"", however more research into how exactly PBM works is needed to understand what it can do.
""There have been many experimental and clinical studies into the use of PBM for various dermatologic conditions, however they have varied in the parameters of the device and treatment protocols,"" he adds.
""Many of these studies were small and unstandardised and often paid for by the manufacturers so it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions"".
He says if someone is keen to buy a device they should make sure they choose one that has EU safety certifications and a high density of LED bulbs on the mask to ensure enough energy is being delivered to the skin.
Dr Kluk also says that she does not ""want to discourage anyone"" who is intrigued by the technology but wants ""them to understand that this is a lot of money to spend on a device, which could potentially support a good skincare routine, or if it's severe like acne, a good prescription regimen and some lifestyle measures - but it's unlikely to do enough on its own.""

Is Trump reining in Musk after a cabinet showdown with secretaries?,"US President Donald Trump called a meeting of his cabinet secretaries on Thursday to discuss Elon Musk and his efforts to slash government spending and personnel numbers.
It turned heated, according to media reports.
Musk accused Secretary of State Marco Rubio of failing to cut enough staff at the state department, reports the New York Times.
The tech mogul told Rubio he was ""good on TV"", according to the newspaper, pointedly skipping any praise of his work as America's top diplomat.
The billionaire also clashed with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy over whether Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) task force had tried to lay off air traffic controllers who were already in short supply in the Federal Aviation Administration, according to the New York Times.
Duffy's department has been under scrutiny after two US airline crashes since Trump took office in January.
After listening to the back-and-forth, the Republican president reportedly intervened to make clear he still supported Doge, but from now on cabinet secretaries would be in charge and the Musk team would only advise.
A state department spokeswoman told the newspaper Rubio felt the cabinet meeting was an ""open and productive discussion"". The White House has not responded to BBC requests for further comment.
Speaking in the Oval Office after the meeting, Trump said cabinet members should decide who to cut, but if they didn't, Musk would do the job.
""I had a meeting, and I said I want the cabinet members to go first"", Trump said. ""And if they can cut it's better, if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting.""
The hastily planned gathering could provide evidence that the president has decided to curtail the sweeping power the SpaceX and Tesla boss and his Doge cost-cutting initiative have commanded in the early weeks of his administration.
Trump first commented on the substance of Thursday's meeting, which was disclosed only in after-the-fact media reports, through a post that evening on his social media site, Truth Social.
He said that he had instructed his secretaries to work with Doge on ""cost-cutting measures"".
""As the secretaries learn about, and understand, the people working for the various departments, they can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go,"" he wrote, adding that they should use a ""scalpel"" not a ""hatchet"".
Just a few weeks ago, Musk wielded a shiny chainsaw at a conservative conference – a visible symbol of aggressive attempts to slash government spending that have angered Democrats and concerned some officials in the Trump administration.
Musk's team had sent multiple emails from an official government account to millions of federal workers, encouraging them to accept months of advance pay in exchange for their resignations.
Federal workers were instructed to provide accounts of their weekly accomplishments or risk firing – a request some agencies instructed their employees to ignore.
Doge also ordered the dismissal of many newly hired government employees who, because of their ""probationary"" status, did not have full civil service protections.
Some government agencies have since rescinded these orders because employees deemed essential, such as those who oversee nuclear weapon security, had been affected.
During an Oval Office event on Friday, Trump responded to questions about the cabinet meeting – and reports of its heated exchanges. He insisted there was ""no clash"". He praised both Rubio and Musk and said the two got along ""great"".
Trump's Thursday Truth Social post, however, appears to give department heads more authority to push back against Musk.
It also may be an attempt to insulate the Trump administration from lawsuits that allege Musk is wielding too much power for someone who, unlike cabinet secretaries, is not subject to Senate review and confirmation.
Several federal judges overseeing these cases have already expressed concern about Musk's authority – concerns that may be further fuelled by Trump's comments during his address to Congress on Tuesday that the billionaire was, in fact, the man in charge of Doge.
Musk and Trump have formed a formidable partnership so far – as the richest man in the world and the most powerful politician in America. Washington has been rife with speculation for months about whether that partnership could ultimately fracture.
Those predictions, however, have usually been followed by renewed signs of comity between the two men.
On Friday night, Musk was seen boarding Air Force One with the president for a flight to Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida for the weekend.
The cabinet room dust-up may be the first crack in the foundation – but there is plenty of evidence that Trump still supports Musk's broader efforts and goals, even if he might prefer he use a scalpel in the days ahead, not a chainsaw.

North Korean hackers cash out hundreds of millions from $1.5bn ByBit hack,"Hackers thought to be working for the North Korean regime have successfully converted at least $300m (£232m) of their record-breaking $1.5bn crypto heist to unrecoverable funds.
The criminals, known as Lazarus Group, swiped the huge haul of digital tokens in a hack on crypto exchange ByBittwo weeks ago.
Since then, it's been a cat-and-mouse game to track and block the hackers from successfully converting the crypto into usable cash.
Experts say the infamous hacking team is working nearly 24 hours a day - potentially funnelling the money into the regime's military development.
""Every minute matters for the hackers who are trying to confuse the money trail and they are extremely sophisticated in what they're doing,"" says Dr Tom Robinson, co-founder of crypto investigators Elliptic.
Out of all the criminal actors involved in crypto currency, North Korea is the best at laundering crypto, Dr Robinson says.
""I imagine they have an entire room of people doing this using automated tools and years of experience. We can also see from their activity that they only take a few hours break each day, possibly working in shifts to get the crypto turned into cash.""
Elliptic's analysis tallies with ByBit, which says that 20% of the funds have now ""gone dark"", meaning it is unlikely to ever be recovered.
The US and allies accuse the North Koreans of carrying out dozens of hacks in recent years to fund the regime's military and nuclear development.
On 21 February the criminals hacked one of ByBit's suppliers to secretly alter the digital wallet address that 401,000 Ethereum crypto coins were being sent to.
ByBit thought it was transferring the funds to its own digital wallet, but instead sent it all to the hackers.
Ben Zhou, the CEO of ByBit, assured customers that none of their funds had been  taken.
The firm has since replenished the stolen coins with loans from investors, but is, in Zhou's words, ""waging war on Lazarus"".
ByBit's Lazarus Bounty programme is encouraging members of the public to trace the stolen funds and get them frozen where possible.
All crypto transactions are displayed on a public blockchain, so it's possible to track the money as it's moved around by the Lazarus Group.
If the hackers try to use a mainstream crypto service to attempt to turn the coins into normal money like dollars, the crypto coins can be frozen by the company if they think they are linked to crime.
So far 20 people have shared more than $4m in rewards for successfully identifying $40m of the stolen money and alerting crypto firms to block transfers.
But experts are downbeat about the chances of the rest of the funds being recoverable, given the North Korean expertise in hacking and laundering the money.
""North Korea is a very closed system and closed economy so they created a successful industry for hacking and laundering and they don't care about the negative impression of cyber crime,"" Dr Dorit Dor from cyber security company Check Point said.
Another problem is that not all crypto companies are as willing to help as others.
Crypto exchange eXch is being accused by ByBit and others of not stopping the criminals cashing out.
More than $90m has been successfully funnelled through this exchange.
But over email the elusive owner of eXch - Johann Roberts - disputed that.
He admits they didn't initially stop the funds, as his company is in a long-running dispute with ByBit, and he says his team wasn't sure the coins were definitely from the hack.
He says he is now co-operating, but argues that mainstream companies that identify crypto customers are betraying the private and anonymous benefits of crypto currency.
North Korea has never admitted being behind the Lazarus Group, but is thought to be the only country in the world using its hacking powers for financial gain.
Previously the Lazarus Group hackers targeted banks, but have in the last five years specialised in attacking cryptocurrency companies.
The industry is less well protected with fewer mechanisms in place to stop them laundering the funds.
Recent hacks linked to North Korea include:
In 2020, the US added North Koreans accused of being part of the Lazarus Group to its Cyber Most Wanted list. But the chances of the individuals ever being arrested are extremely slim unless they leave their country.

Places around the world that opt out of daylight savings - and why,"The pros and cons of daylight saving sparks debate around the world. Here's why some places have opted out.
Over thelast decade, countries and states around the world have abolished the practice of daylight saving time for various reasons, while other locations still cling to the practice despitehealth expertssaying itis damaging.
Seasonal clock shifts involve ""springing"" the clock forwards one hour in the spring to be on daylight savings time and ""falling"" backwards one hour in autumn to be on standard time. According to a 2023 analysis by Pew Research Center,halfof countries globally previously observed these clock changes. Now, only aboutone thirdmaintain the custom.
The bulk of the United States, most of Europe, and parts of Canada, Australia, Latin America, Brazil and the Caribbean have remainedholdoutsand still adjust their clocks. But plenty of places around the world have opted out of it entirely. These include all of Asia, and most of Africa. Over the past 10 years, Azerbaijan, Iran, Jordan, Namibia, Russia, Samoa, Syria, Turkey, Uruguay and most of Mexico have all ended the practice,according to the Pew Research Center. In the United States, Hawaii and Arizona skip the practice, as do American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.
In December 2024, Donald Trump indicated that he wanted to end daylight saving time in the US, describing it as ""inconvenient"" and ""very costly"", but when asked inMarch 2025 about the issue, the US president took a step back, saying it was a ""50-50 issue"".
But why do some people want to abolish daylight savings? Experts cite safety, health, and climate issues as reasons why daylight saving shifts should be abolished.
Jagdish Khubchandani, professor of public health at New Mexico State University, shares that some research has indicated a correlation between clock shifts and health problems ranging from sleep disruptions to heart attacks.
""Other studies and experts have also discussedaccidents,mental health, well-being, etc,"" he adds. That said, ""one could easily argue that these are short-term effects of transitions and more long-term studies are needed"", he concludes.
Time shifts, such as those related to daylight saving, disruptcircadian rhythms, also known as the sleep-wake cycle. Disruption has been shown toincrease disease severity.
""The most important synchronizer of our circadian rhythms is the daylight, which helps all our body clocks to stay in sync,"" saysTord Wingren, an engineer who studies sleep and light exposure. Wingren does own a company that sells natural lighting alternatives; however, he is advocating for the change to abolish daylight saving time so that people would have access to natural morning light without these product aids.
Exposure tolightin the morningcuesone's circadian-rhythm. Tissues throughout the body have peripheral clocks that sync, based on these cues, to our master body clock in the brain. That master clock, in response to light exposure via the eyes, is responsible for kicking off a cascade ofhormonal processes. The hormones affected include those related to stress, blood sugar management, and hunger and satisfaction signalling.
""Clock shifting can deprive working individuals [and] school-going populations from this boost, as they may have to start their day in darker times,"" Khubchandani says.
Exposure to darkness is a good thing at night, when it helps the body producemelatonin, a hormone that prepares the body for sleep. But thanks to clock shifts, ""the extra light during evenings may delay our sleeping times [and] routines"", Khubchandani explains.
Researchers from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine wrote a 2020 positionstatementin the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine noting that springing forwards is indeed harmful.
The AASP researchers use ""social jet lag"" as a term to describe the chronic misalignment between one's natural sleep-wake cycle and life's demands from work, school and family, noting that daylight saving directly causes that social jet lag. It can be even worse in the western-most areas of a time zone. Social jet lag isassociatedwith obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and depression.
""It is, therefore, the position of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine that these seasonal time changes should be abolished in favour of a fixed, national, year-round standard time,"" the researcherswrite.
Daylight savings time practices have beenlinkedto increases indeadly traffic accidents,workplace injuries,medical errorsand overallmortality.
In 2018, researchers in Spain penned a letter that was published in the journal Epidemiology regarding a link betweendeadly car accidentsand daylight savings shifts. After collecting data from cities in Spain between 1990 and 2014, the researchers found a30%increase in fatal traffic accidents on the day clocks sprang forwards. On the day clocks fell backwards, they saw an increase of 16%.
An older study from 2009, published in the Journal of Applied Psychology used data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to see if daylight saving was associated with more workplace injuries. They found a nearly6%increase in injuries on the Monday after clocks sprang forward.
In a 2021 observational study, researchers from the Mayo Clinic in the United States looked at whether daylight saving timeincreased the risk of medical errors. They examined data from voluntarily reported safety-related incidents from facilities in the United States occurring from 2010 to 2017. They then refined the data by looking at instances likely stemming from human error that occurred in the week prior to and the week after daylight savings clock shifts.
Overall, they found an almost19%increase in safety-related incidents in the seven days after clocks sprang forwards and an almost5%increase in the seven days after clocks fell back. The study authors attribute the increase to an average of nearly 40 minutes less of sleep for workers.
One of the serious health concerns related to time shifts isacute myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Researchers in Italy wrote a 2018 review published in the journal Internal Emergency Medicine investigating daylight savings' potential effects on heart health. They reviewed seven existing studies from the United States and Europe looking at more than 80,000 cases of acute myocardial infarction. They found an increase, from4% to 29%, in heart attacks after clocks sprang forwards.
Incidence ofstrokemay also increase after a clock shift. For a 2016 study published in the journal Sleep Medicine, researchers in Finland investigated the connection. They analysed more than 3,000 hospitalizations from 2004 to 2013 that occurred in the week following seasonal clock changes. They next compared those cases to a control group of 11,000 expected hospitalizations. The findings showed that hospitalizations for ischaemic stroke, the most common type, increased by8%in the two days following a daylight savings shift. When looking at the whole week post-shift, the increase was3%. The association was stronger for people assigned female at birth and those who were older.
""[Daylight savings] can potentially influence one's cardiovascular health as well as contribute to mood disturbances and disruption of cognitive performance,"" saysNesochi Okeke-Igbokwe,an internist in private practice.
For a 2017 study published in the journal Epidemiology, researchers used records from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register. They analysed nearly 200,000 hospital contacts for unipolar depression from 1995 to 2012. The findings showed an11%increase in unipolar depressive episodes after the spring clock shift. The increase dissipated over the 10 weeks following the clock change.
Although implementation dates for countries varied, the first discussions on implementation of daylight saving occurred in 1916. However,Benjamin Franklinis credited with the original concept after analysing candle consumption in 1784 and suggesting people alter their overall sleep schedules tosave money on lighting costs.
US National Archivesattribute Germany as having the earliest experience with daylight saving during World War One. Reasons for implementation involved saving on energy bills, having more daylight in the evening for leisure time, and more.
The research available on whether daylight savings shifts actually do save energy is limited and mixed, however. One older US report shows a potential decrease in energy use of0.5%, while another older report shows an increase of4%usage.
The state of Arizona, on the other hand, optedoutof daylight savings shifts in order to save energy. It is one of the few US states that does not participate in daylight saving practices. According to Arizona State University, the state implemented daylight saving in1967and abolished it that same year (however, the Navajo Nation within Arizona still participates) because Arizonans found that the clock change caused a surge in energy consumption. The desert state is notably hot, and people had to run their air conditioners for longer into the evening, driving energy use and costs. As the globeheats updue to climate change, more states, provinces and countries may follow suit.
In 2018, the European Commissionproposedan end to clock shifts. However, the European Council has not agreed on its position. The European Parliament voted in favour of adopting the change. However the Council and Parliament must reach an agreement for the change to occur.
""Unfortunately, it seems Sweden [is] waiting on unity within EU before acting,"" says Wingren, who resides in the country. ""There was news two to three years ago about that Sweden should stop using DST, but this was never implemented.”
In a different take, Florida Senator Marco Rubio introduced theSunshine Protection Actin March 2023. If passed, the bill would make daylight saving times permanent in the United States, but the proposed legislation, after passing in the Senate, hasstalledin the House of Representatives.
If passed in the future, the bill would mean the US would spring clocks forwards a final time and not fall back six months later. However, the delay of sunlight in the morning and the extended sunlight in the evening has health experts, such as Khubchandani, concerned.
""We need natural light to start our days well, with more alertness, and brighter mood (via secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters,"" he says.
That’s why the American Academy of Sleep Medicine advocates for the opposite. ""Current evidence best supports the adoption of year-round standard time, which aligns best with human circadian biology and provides distinct benefits for public health and safety,"" the organisationwrotein response to the bill.
Another consideration regarding time shifts is what the public thinks about the practice.
""Public health is of the people and for the people,"" Khubchandani explains. ""So there is a public perception related to preferences. There are not too many polls across the nation that support the practice of DST/shifting clocks.""
In a Monmouth University Poll, researchers found that just abouttwo-thirdsof people in the US would prefer to nix the practice of seasonal time shifts.
A governmental survey from British Columbia, Canada, found that93%of respondents want to end the shifts and stay on daylight savings time permanently. The European Commission conducted a survey in 2018, and84%of respondents were in favour of ending daylight saving time. And a YouGov survey in the UK found that44%of Britons want to continue with it.

'The space is like an instrument': How Notre-Dame found its voice after fire muffled it,"Performers and visitors to the famous gothic cathedral in the midst of the River Seine may find some subtle differences to the way sound bounces around its walls.
The Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris has borne witness to many turning points in history. The building's striking gothic stonework has stood sentry on an island in the midst of the River Seine since the late 12th Century ascoronations, wars and revolutionshave unfolded in its shadow. What you might not realise, however, is that the cathedral has played a key part in shaping the music you hear when you turn on the radio or stream a playlist.
Notre-Dame was, for a brief time, the beating heart of a musical revolution – one that changed music forever and laid the foundations for many of the songs we listen to today.
Up until the middle of the 12th Century in Medieval Europe, it was common to hear the haunting melodic chants of the clergy echoing through churches and cathedrals.Gregorian chant, or plainsong, was the musical style of the day, where sacred texts were sung either by a single voice or a choir in unison – something known as monophony.
But faced with the Notre-Dame's soaring nave, ribbed vaults and towering columns, a group of composers began to try something different to take advantage of the waysound rattled around inside the building. They introducedmultiple lines of melody simultaneouslyto produce elaborate polyphonic arrangements, ormotets– the early beginnings of a musical texture that is a common feature in modern music, from jazz to pop and hip-hop.
""They had to figure out a way to sing in there thatworked with the architecture,"" says Brian Katz, an expert on acoustics and research director at the Institut D'Alembert at Sorbonne University in France.
Katz has spent more than a decade studying theacoustics of Notre-Dame, painstakingly hanging microphones and taking measurements to reconstruct what it would have sounded like toplay music,singandpreachinside the cathedral at different points in its evolution. Now, Katz hopes to return with his microphones and equipment as Notre-Dame enters a new phase. The cathedral recently reopened for the first time after thedevastating firethat destroyed the roof, spire and much of the interior of the cathedral in April 2019. Thereconstruction– which reportedly cost€700m(£582m, $758) – saw the building restored stone by stone to how it had been before the blaze.
But Katz believes something may have changed – the way it sounds.
""It's hard to tell exactly how it has changed but we expect it to be more reverberant,"" he says. Katz has visited Notre-Dame several times to attend masses and performances since it officially reopened on 7 December 2024. The experience has been ""incredibly moving"", he says.
But as he sat in different parts of the cathedral, he also couldn't shake the sensation that it sounded different. A new sound system and the extensivecleaning of the organ's 8,000 pipesduring the restoration work have certainly contributed to that, but he believes that the way sound interplays with the fabric of the building itself is also subtly different.
""The organist has already stated that it will take a bit of time to adapt to the subtle changes in the restored acoustics and organ,"" he says. ""This is very typical of say a new concert hall, where the resident orchestra – and audience – need a few months to adjust to new conditions. The space is like an instrument, and one needs to become familiar with it to get the best out of it.""
Katz and his research group at Sorbonne University have worked alongside the architects and builders charged with restoring the cathedral since the fire. They were eager not to lose the unique acoustics of Notre-Dame as the physical building was pieced back together.
""The next day [after the fire], I started getting calls,"" says Katz. ""Colleagues were saying, 'you have those acoustic measurements at Notre-Dame and nobody else has any'.""
Katz and his colleagues had gathered these during a series of extensive acoustic surveys of the building in 2015, where they hung microphones in 16 different positions at a time and played sounds from an omnidirectional loudspeaker – a sphere with 12 separate speakers pointing in different directions. They repeated this multiple times in different locations to build up a full acousticmodel of the cathedral's interior.
For those who perform inside Notre-Dame cathedral, it is an enlivening experience. The complex stonework and vaulted ceilings make it a challenging but interesting place to sing.
""The greatest privilege is to be able to sing in the evening after closing time, to prepare a concert, and to enjoy the empty cathedral and make its stones vibrate with music,"" says Henri Chalet, director of the Maîtrise Notre-Dame de Paris music school, which has had an association with the cathedral since it was founded in the 12th Century. ""There is an extra soul in this cathedral, which everyone can define in their own way. It is clearly alive.""
Gustavo Dudamel, the Venezuelan conductor who led the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France at the reopening of Notre-Dame on 7 December 2024, and who led performances there before the fire, agrees there is something special about the building.
""Notre Dame is one of the most magical performance spaces in the world,"" he says. ""Of course there are challenges to coordinating any kind of live performance in such a reverberant acoustic, but the sheer transcendental nature of the cathedral turns that work into a gift.""
In the aftermath of the fire in 2019, Katz's team visited the cathedral again, sending their microphones bobbing around debris and scaffolding on a robot normally used to inspect sewer pipes. When they did the measurements, it became apparent just how much of Notre-Dame's special sound had been lost.
""It's dark, you can still smell the carbon and smoke and there's basically 3-4 big holes in the roof,"" recalls Katz. Those holes combined with the blanket of soot had adulling effect on the sound. The reverberation time – how long it takes for an acoustic signal to decay within a space – decreased by around 8% compared with before the fire.
When they plugged the data into their ""digital twin"" of Notre-Dame, they found the acoustics were similar to another key moment in the Cathedral's past.
""It corresponds to the most [sound] absorbing condition we have predicted in Notre-Dame,"" says Katz. ""If you look atNapoleon's coronation– the records of that and the paintings of that show every surface is covered in fabric. When we try to replicate that, we end up with something quite similar to the post fire condition.""
In other-words, the voice of Notre-Dame had been muffled by the blaze.
Over the months that followed the fire, there were no shortages of proposals for how the grand cathedral could be reconstructed. Architects suggested radical changes such as aglass roof or even a garden on top of the buildingbefore the French President Emmanuel Macron announced the cathedral would be restored to its condition before the fire.
Even so, Katz and his colleagues were called upon to help with critical decisions that could influence the overall acoustics inside the cathedral. ""One of the things that we were tasked with in the reconstruction was to evaluate the proposals for the new choir organ,"" says Katz. ""They were thinking about moving it and making it larger."" One of the proposals was to put the organ up in the triforium – the gallery tucked high above the nave, the main open space of the cathedral – rather than beneath it, where it had been before the fire.
""Putting it up higher would mean it had a better view,"" says Katz. ""But the prediction we got from our digital twin was that most of the energy from an organ up there would stay up in the upper space. It would just go from triforium to triforium and didn't really get down to the audience in the way they wanted. So, in the end, they kept it where it was before.""
It is a clear illustration of just what a complex space Notre-Dame is from an acoustic perspective. The triforium in Notre-Dame runs on either side of the nave, but then stops at the transept.
""It creates this barrier between the choir side and the nave side, which affects how sound propagates from one to the other,"" says Katz. He experienced this for himself before the fire when he watched a performance of choir soloists.
""During the performance they would move back and forth, taking four or five steps,"" he says. ""When they came closer to us, all of a sudden we were in a small room with them, and they would take a couple of steps back, and their voices excited the whole space, and they felt much farther away. You really get the feel of that barrier.""
While Notre-Dame was reconstructed to replicate how it had been before the fire, there are a few crucial changes that Katz believes have altered the sound inside the cathedral. Among those is the removal of a long carpet that ran around much of the outer perimeter of the building's interior. It had been installed in the late eighties to absorb footfall noise from tourists on the hard marble floor.
More like this:
During their research, Katz and his colleagues had discovered recordings from an acoustic survey conducted in 1987 when there were proposals to install a new organ in the cathedral. When they compared the data with the survey Katz had conducted in 2015, it revealed a strange difference.
""There was anoticeable shift in the reverberation time, in a way that should be perceptible,"" Katz says. With the carpet now gone and the bare marble floor once more exposed, Katz says it is likely the reverberation will have increased again to how it was nearly half a century ago.
Many of the other soft furnishings such as wall hangings have also gone after being damaged in the fire while1,500 solid wood chairsnow sit where there were once rows of chairs with woven seats.
Another change that may affect the acoustics lies with the stonework itself. During the reconstruction process the building was given what effectively amounts to a giant facemask.
""They had to remove all the lead dust so what they effectively did was spray liquid latex onto the walls and peel it off like a skin,"" says Katz. ""It gets into all the crevices and pulls out all the dust in there. The paint work and plasterwork is new too. So in that respect we expect it to be much more reverberant than it was before the fire.""
For those performing in the cathedral, it has taken only a little time to get used to singing with the unique acoustics inside Notre-Dame again after a five-year absence.
""The Maîtrise used to sing there all the time,"" says Chalet. ""Then for more than five years, we discovered many different places in Paris, in France and even abroad. This allowed us to learn to adapt very quickly to a new acoustic. Now we take advantage of each service and each concert to tame this demanding but benevolent acoustic.""
Both he and Dudamel say they haven't noticed any significant difference in how the space sounds during performances. Dudamel says due to the difference in the set up between the performances he led in the cathedral before and after the fire, it is particularly difficult to compare.
""No doubt acoustic studies will show differences, but honestly, the cathedral is very large and has been rebuilt exactly as it was,"" adds Chalet. ""It is just that the stone has been cleaned which can make the sound reflect a little differently. But my memories of it before the fire are broadly the same.""
But both men have another theory for why the auditory experience inside the cathedral may feel different to visitors today.
""Due to the lighting – which is a lot brighter – and the cleanliness of the windows, which puts a huge amount of added brightness in the space, I think there is a palpable difference in how the musicians and audience feed that information into what they are hearing, perhaps creating the impression that the sound is brighter and clearer now,"" says Dudamel.
Chalet agrees. ""The sight of a cathedral, the discovery of the restored chapels that you could not see before because they were so dark, gives the impression that the cathedral has become wider. The sight clearly has an impact on listening.""
Certainly, there is some research that suggestsvisual information can affect our experience of what we hear.
Of course, to determine exactly how much it has changed will require more tests by Katz and his colleagues. But in many ways, he feels, the cathedral has been given a new life acoustically, that is potentially allowing visitors to experience sound in Notre-Dame in a way that probably hasn't been possible for hundreds of years.
""In some ways it is like a brand-new cathedral,"" says Katz. ""One that is 800 years old.""

What we've learned about cleaning up major oil spills since Deepwater Horizon,"Major oil spills can be catastrophic for seabirds and marine life. Nearly 15 years on from the biggest marine spill in history, are we any better at cleaning up oil at sea? Jocelyn Timperley examines the latest science of ocean clean-ups.
On April 20, 2010, a blowout caused a huge explosion on the offshore drilling rig operated by BP in the Gulf of Mexico.Eleven people were killed. Two days later, the rig collapsed. Oil began seeping into the sea, and it continued to flow for almost three months.
The Deepwater Horizon disaster is among the most lamented environmental catastrophes of the past century. It's hard to comprehend how incredibly huge the spill was. It was the world'slargest ever marine oil spill, releasing anestimated 4.9 million barrels of crude oil(779 million litres, or over 300Olympic swimming pools-worth).Up toamillionseabirdswerekilled outright, and thehuman health and socioeconomic effectsare still being felt today.
BP, rig operator Transocean, and several government agenciesimmediately tried to limit the damage, with BP's chief executivesayingthe company was ""determined to do everything in our power"" to contain the spill. Booms were deployed to try to contain the oil, skimmer ships nibbled at the edges of the widening slick and fires were set to try to burn it off the sea surface. Various devices weredeployed deep below the surface to try to contain or capture the oil. BP alsobegan to spray the oil with enormous amounts of dispersantsboth on the sea surface and 1.5km (0.9 miles) underwater, where oil was gushing from the wellhead.
However, it is thought that these measuresrecovered or dispersed only around a third ofthe spilled oil. The BP spill sparkeda huge amount of researchinto oil spills and their impacts. But 14 years on, what hope is there for better measures should another oil spill occur?
Jeffrey Short, an expert in oil spills and now-retired scientist from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), was working for Oceana, a marine conservation organisation when the BP spill occurred. When a colleague told him about the spill at lunchtime, he felt sick.
""I knew immediately that this would be ecologically and economically disastrous, that it would wreck tens of thousands of people's lives, and that it would dominate my professional life for the next several years,"" he says. ""All of which proved true.""
Oil spills arethe third largest source of oil in the sea, after land-based runoff (largely from cities and vehicles) and natural oil seeps. The problem with spills, of course, is the sheer volume of oil that enters the sea all at once. This means that oil spills – especially big ones – are ""much, much more dangerous per unit oil released"", says Short.
While no spill has since surpassed Deepwater Horizon's in sheer volume, Noaaresponds to more than 150 oil spills every year. Just last month, oil began spewing from a submergedoil tanker and at least two other sunken vessels in Manila Bay, in the Philippines, after they were hit bymonsoon rains and Typhoon Gaemi. Anotheroil tanker hit by projectiles from Yemen's Houthi movementremains in a precarious position in the Red Sea. However, the number of oil spills from tankersis today far lower than in the 1970s, due to improved standards.
When oil spills occur, the first step is to control the source, ""whether that be a ship, pipeline, or leaking well"", says Doug Helton, regional supervisor of the emergency response division at Noaa'sOffice of Response and Restoration. ""The second priority is recovering oil at sea.""
The major priority is to avoid the oil reaching the shoreline, where it can do the most damage. Shoreline cleanups can last days to years, depending on the type of oil and severity of contamination, says Helton.
Spilt oil tends to spread quickly into a thin layer on the sea surface. Within days, centimetres-thick layers become a film of a millimetre or less, spread in drifting patches over a wide area. Efforts to scoop up the oil from the sea surface therefore offer diminishing returns as time goes on. ""Floating oil spreads very quickly and there is a limited window of time – days – when at-sea tools are effective,"" says Helton.
Hundreds of skimmerswere deployed to clean up the BP Deep Horizon spill. Skimmers are boats that scoop up spilled oil from the water's surface, usually after the slick is first surrounded with floating booms to keep it from spreading. They do this in various ways – some, for example,suck up the oil like a vacuum cleaner, whileothers use oil-attracting ""conveyor belts""or gravity to carry the spilled oil into a reservoir.
But hopes at the time that the skimmers could pick up oil""like a lawnmower cutting grass""proved to be overblown. They only recoveredan estimated 3%of the oil. ""At sea, the oil may spread more rapidly than the skimming vessels trying to capture oil,"" says Helton. ""Going faster is not an easy option because the bow wave from the ship will push the oil away.""
Thesatellite photos of the BP disaster""speak volumes"", says Short. ""You'll see a half a dozen surface skimming boats that, from the sea surface next to the boat, look quite large and quite effective. But from a satellite, you realise that you are [...] just having a nearly negligible effect on the size of the spill.""
In fact, a 2020review of 30 large offshore oil spillsfound only 2-6% of oil was recovered using mechanical methods like skimmers. Short says that mechanical recovery has improved in recent decades, with better booms to corral the oil and better systems to remove it from the sea surface. But even with improvements, mechanical methods can't have much impact on a large spill, he says.
In recent years a plethora of studies and reports have emerged looking at different ways to soak up oil spills, fromlaser-treated corkandtextiles based on leavestographene,magnetsand evenhair and fur. These mostly rely on the oil-attracting and water-hating properties of the material, withvariousforms of oil-attractingspongesa particularly commonsolution. But the difficulty of handling oil-soaked materials means these techniques aretypically only useful for small spills.
When Guihua Yu, a professor of materials science at the University of Texas at Austin, and his team began considering whether a new material his lab was working on could be used to help clean up oil spills, he says he was surprised about the lack of focus on how these innovative materials could be used in practice.
One central problem, he says, is that most can only be used in a non-continuous way, requiring processing to remove the oil before the same material can be used again.
Yu and his team landed on a solution which he thinks could help. In a 2023 paper, his lab developed a prototype with a collection speed10 times faster than current clean up rates.
The lab produced their own super oleophilic gelcapable of 99% separationof oil from water, which they used to cover a mesh filter. But they also designed a continuous roller system, which Yu says would be attached to the front of a ship. This conveyer belt picks up oil from the water surface, then rolls it round to beside an induction heater, which heats the oil, detaching it and allowing it to drip down to a collector in the middle. The roller is freed up to be directly reused as it rolls down to the water again.
""The most important [innovation in our work] is probably higher throughput,"" says Yu. ""I personally felt it's very unique and very different from what is conventional.""
The invention has so far only been tested on a small motor oil spill in a lake in China using a metre-scale prototype, but Yu says he has had conversations with industry potentially interested in scaling it up. The overall costs, he believes, would be reasonable. However, he admits his current design does not address the bow-wave issue of oil being pushed away from the ship, noting that how to balance collection and bow wave is ""worthy of further investigation"".
But Short says that, for large spills which require more than a day to clean up, movement of oil during the night (when operationscan usually not be carried out) will always limit the efficacy of collecting oil on the sea surface.
""The following day, the oil must first be located before response equipment can be effectively deployed,"" he says. ""For large spills, especially when response equipment is limited, these challenges may limit the amount of recoverable oil to less than 10% of the initial spill volume.""
Still, improvements have been made intracking the oil too. Noaa now uses drones andsatellitesto help find and track oil spills, and tools formappingandcoordinationhave advanced. Undersea manned and autonomous tools that can tap into sunken vessels to extract oil have also been developed since the Deepwater Horizon spill, says Helton.
Burning is another, more controversial, way to remove floating oil at sea.An estimated 5%of the BP oil spill was burnt off the surface.
Burning requires concentrating the oil on the sea surface toat least 2-3mm– relatively thick for an oil spill. It also requires quick action, and lucky weather conditions. In the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska in 1989,a storm dispersed the oil over a wide areainto a film too thin to catch alight.
Improved boom designs to better corral oil have improved the effectiveness of burning over the years, says Short. But successful burning also has its own problemsfor the environment and human healthin the form ofair pollution.
The impacts ofair pollutionon the workers attempting to clean up the BP oil spill arestill being investigated today. A major2022 studyfound that workers involved in cleaning up the spill were 60% more likely to be diagnosed with asthma or experience asthma symptoms one to three years after the spill, compared with those who did not work on the cleanup.
Burning is not the only culprit for air pollution. The evaporation of the oil itself isalso highly toxic, as is another controversial way to try to dissipate the impacts of oil spills: dispersants.
During the Deepwater Horizon disaster, BP sprayedroughly 1.84 million gallons(8.37 million litres) of the dispersant Corexit on the surface and deep into the water column – thelargest volume of dispersant ever used for an oil spill.
Dispersantswork by breaking down the oil into smaller dropletsthat can mix with the water below, which both helps it to degrade and removes it from the surface, where it tends to do most damage (especially todiving seabirds, surfacing marine mammals, turtlesandyoung fish). But it needs to be added quickly after oil spills.
Little was known about exactly how this quantity of dispersant would affect the environment in the BP spill, but the hope was that it would stop the oil from reaching shoreline habitats. But the sheer volume used has been widely criticised as largelyineffectiveas well as harmful to theenvironmentandhumans. It's thoughtjust 8%of the oil was dispersed using Corexit.
In Short's view,prior knowledgeabout oil spills meant that in the Deepwater Horizon spill ""you can be quite certain in advance"" that the continued application of dispersants on parts of the oil slick which had already emulsified was ""a waste of time"" beyond the first few days. ""But it shows the public that you're doing something.""
Environmentalists and scientists havea termfor these kinds of reactions to oil spills – ""response theatre"". It describes when companies responsible for a spill focus more on being seen to do something about the spill than necessarily doing the best thing.
Some researchers, however,say the dispersants were relatively effectiveand may have helped avoid further air pollution by getting rid of the oil. A 2019report from the US National Academiesfound that dispersants can help cope with oil spills in some circumstances, but that limitations in the research make it hard to make conclusions about whether it improves the human health aspect compared to not using dispersants.
Still, counterintuitive as it may sound, there are occassions where some interventions could be a worse option thanleaving an oil spill alone. In many places, ocean microbes have developed to eat theoil seeping naturally into the environment. These same bacteria and fungican munch away at oil spills too– albeit relatively slowly andsome more than others– but if they areimpacted by chemicals, such as those in dispersants, this processcould be disrupted.
Bioremediation – such as adding nutrients to encourage oil-degrading bacteria – hasa long history of use in oil spills. But scientists are still at the beginning of understanding the complex interactions between microbial communities and chemical dispersants, as well as how these interact with environmental factors like temperature and sunlight.Research, for example, hasshownthat sunlight levels impact oil degradation in different microbes differently.
Astudy published in 2024became the first to usean advanced microbiology techniqueto look at these interactions. Rather than look at the DNA of microbes, as previous studies have done, the scientists examined the protein expression of microbes in waters off the coast of Florida – a technique usually only used in medical or clinical science.
Using these techniques can show far more detail than looking at DNA alone, says Sabine Matallana-Surget, an associate professor of environmental and molecular microbiology at the University of Stirling, Scotland, who led the study. If she did a similar study on humans, for example, she would be able to tell when they had lunch by tracking the enzymes involved in food digestion.
More like this:
Her team found that Corexit induces a high expression of proteins involved in oxidative stress in oil-degrading bacteria. ""I have never seen so many proteins involving DNA damage [and] repair, [as] when you introduce the Corexit to your microbial community,"" says Matallana-Surget. More sunlight also increased the toxicity of Corexit and oil in their experiment, creating a ""double pill effect"", she adds.
The team plan to conduct similar experiments in other places with natural seepages of oil, with different microbes, temperature and sunlight levels. If there is another oil spill in one of these places, Matallana-Surget says, these findings could inform the optimum level of Corexit to use in that particular location for maximum oil recovery. ""I'm hoping that in the near future, if there was an accident somewhere else, we would be able to say, 'Well, listen, no, you shouldn't apply Corexit in that region, or not as much, or maybe this concentration.'""
Dispersants aren't the only intervention after oil spills that have caused concern. ""We have found after lengthy research that aggressive cleanup of some environments can cause more harm than the oil,"" says Helton. ""Marshes and sheltered intertidal habitats, for example, are often treatedvery carefully.""
Thehigh-pressure, hot-water washingused to clean the ecologically sensitive shorelines of Prince William Sound in Alaska after the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, for example, sterilised the beaches,inadvertently killing bacteria as well as larger animals. Research hasshown that areas not cleaned by the hot water recovered faster than the treated sites.
If a spill like Deepwater Horizon happened today, says Matallana-Surget, the reaction would be completely different. ""There have been huge conversations around what happened with applying tonnes of [a] chemical [where] we have no idea what's going in the environment. I think nobody in any part of the world would do that.""
Ultimately, since spills are so hard to clean up, avoiding them happening in the first place remains the most important thing. ""Prevention is going to be the most fruitful line of approach,"" says Short. ""Continuing to implement safety measures and especially being vigilant."" The problem is that standards are expensive to maintain, he says. If years go by without a spill, they ""tend to start slipping"".
Major changeshave been made to US regulations governing offshore oil and gas operations, as well as advances in preventing blowouts in the first place. New performance measures and enforcement mechanisms have been introduced to improve pipeline safety. However, there arealso new potential risksfor oil spills:deeper drilling, ageing infrastructure, transport of new types of oil and through different routes such as the Arctic, and climate impacts like sea-level rise and more intense and frequent storms.
Areportreleased by BP in September 2010 concluded that decisions made by ""multiple companies and work teams"", including BP and others, had contributed to the spill. The unprecedented costs –over $65bn (£49bn)– to BP of the Deepwater Horizon has acted as an incentive to companies maintain the vigilance to avoid future disasters, says Short. ""I think that's really got a lot of attention in the industry, that this is not a trivial operating expense that you can just write off as business as usual.""
BP also quickly announced $500m (£380m) for a10 year research programme, which has beencreditedwith galvanising advancement in oil spill science.
But while risks can be reduced, so long as oil is being produced, ""you're not going to get rid of [spills]"", adds Short. Oil supply is set to reacha record high this year, with the US last year producing more oil thanany country ever has before. Until oil dependence begins to fall, sadly the risks of another oil spill will stay with us.
Both BP and ExxonMobil declined to comment for this article.

The hidden world beneath the shadows of YouTube's algorithm,"There's a secret side of YouTube, just beyond the guiding hand of the algorithm – and it’s nothing like what you know. The vast majority of YouTube's estimated 14.8 billion videos have almost never been seen. Until now.
This year marks YouTube's 20th birthday. From its humble beginnings as a venue for amateurs, today YouTube is such a behemoth that the company calls itself thenew Hollywood. YouTube is the world'snumber one TV streaming service, where users clock billions of hours of watching every day. Leading YouTubers regularly outperform big-name studios. For comparison, anestimated823 million cinema tickets were sold across all of the US and Canada in 2024. Meanwhile, MrBeast's most successful video alone racked up 762 million views, about one watch for every 10 people on earth.
That's the vision of YouTube the companypromotes– slick, professional, entertaining and loud – but from one perspective, it's all a façade.
Through another lens, the essence of YouTube is more like thisvideo from 2020. Before I watched, it had only been seen twice. A man points the camera out of his bedroom window as a flurry breaks out in the dead of winter. ""Here it is,"" he says. ""The falling snow."" The sound of a TV plays in the background. A bird lands on a nearby fence. 19 minutes go by. Nothing happens.
""The conversations we're having about YouTube are based on an impoverished view of what the platform really is,"" says Ryan McGrady, the senior researcher in the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the US. ""When we just focus on what's popular, we miss how the vast majority of people actually use YouTube as uploaders, and overlooking the role it plays in our society.""
I spent the last month dipping into one of the firsttruly random samplesof YouTube ever collected outside the company. I saw a side of the internet that sometimes feels lost, one full of pure, unvarnished self-expression. It's an entire world that YouTube's all-seeing algorithm won't show you.
""YouTube isn't just a vehicle for professionals,"" McGrady says. ""We rely on it as the default video arm of the internet. YouTube is infrastructure. It's a critical tool that regular people use to communicate.""
To unveil this side of YouTube, McGrady and his colleagues built atool that dials videos at random. The scraper tried more than 18 trillion potential URLs before it collected a big enough sample forreal scientific analysis. Among the findings the researchers estimate that the median video has been watchedjust 41 times; posts with more than 130 views are actually in the top third of the service's most popular content. In other words, the vast majority of YouTube is practically invisible.
Most of these videos aren't meant for us to see. They exist because people need a digital attic to store their memories. It's an internet unshaped by the pressures of clicks and algorithms – a glimpse into a place where content doesn't have to perform, where it can simply exist.
Twelve years ago, a woman from the US named Emily posted a YouTube video called ""sw33t tats"". I learned it's even older than that, recorded around 2008. In the video, Emily, who asked to withhold her full name, sits in her college dorm room. She pries her mouth open as her younger sister brings a marker to the inside of Emily's lower lip.
""Stop moving!"", her sister yells as she starts to write, the girls barely able to control their laughter. Emily holds her lip open to the camera, and her sister does the same, revealing a sweet tat of her own. But the footage is blurry; whatever these fake tattoos said is lost to time.
Emily, now 34 and living in New York City, forgot this video existed until I asked her about it. ""I don't even remember why I uploaded this,"" she says. ""I think wanted to send it to my sister, but I also I had to free up space on my hard drive. I just needed a place to put it. I don't know, it's funny and weird. I'm glad it's still here.""
""We tend to assume the reason to use social media is to try to be an influencer, either you're Joe Rogan or you're a failure. But that's the wrong way to think about it,"" says Ethan Zuckerman, who leads the YouTube research as the director of the University of Massachusetts' Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure.
YouTube tells the BBC it's incorrect to say the platform doesn't let you see videos with low views or content from small channels. The algorithm's job is to help people find the videos they want to watch and that will give them value, YouTube says, and sometimes that does include videos with a small number of views.
""The magic of YouTube is that whether a video has 60 views or six million, people are able to find community, learn a new skill, be entertained, or share their voice with the world,"" says Boot Bullwinkle, a YouTube spokesperson. ""Every channel starts from the same blank slate, from which they can build an audience and grow a business.""
Zuckerman and his colleagues weren't the first to go looking for YouTube's underbelly. Between 2009 and 2012, for instance, iPhones included a feature that let users post videos straight to YouTube with a few taps. YouTube reported that mobile uploadsjumped 400%a day. Unless people added a custom title, the name for all these videos followed a standard format, which makes them easily searchable over a decade later. A few online tinkerers haveexplored these videos, which apparently number in the millions. One even built acustom playerthat cycles through them.
Without the algorithm's recommendations, you'll find that YouTube is a study of the everyday, Zuckerman says, people documenting small moments in their lives and using the available tools to exchange ideas.
In South Asia, for example, Zuckerman says YouTube and similar networks seem to function as a video messaging tool for people with low or no literacy. Most of YouTube comes from outside of the US, in fact. Zuckerman's lab has estimated thatover 70% of YouTubevideos are in languages other than English. You find fisherman in South America waving from a boat, or two construction workers speaking in Hindi about how much they miss home. Videos like these fall under what he calls ""friends and family"" content, where comments and interactions all come from people who seem to know the user personally.
""If any of these videos went viral, it would mean something went terribly wrong. That's not what most of YouTube for,"" Zuckerman says.
Most unwatched YouTube is less entertaining than sw33t tats, which, with respect to Emily, sets a low bar. This stuff is bland enough to melt your brain. A bride gets ready for a photo shoot. A grouchy Korean man rants about politics. Six seconds of a martial arts instructor, devoid of context. Dash camera footage from a car struggling to escape a parking lot. A woman advertises a horse for sale in 2018. Endless, mundane screen recordings of video games – the University of Massachusetts Amhurststudy foundpeople playing video games seems to make up almost 20% of YouTube.
Occasionally, you stumble on something fun, or more often, just plain weird. Three men performatively slapping each other's rear ends to a James Brown song. A woman reviews a brand of pre-sliced bologna (it's ""not too bad""). Or take the channel ""Space Stuff and Other Stuff"", where a kidraps about the planet Neptuneand shares hiscondolencesafter Queen Elizabeth's passing. The latter falls in the ""other stuff"" category, apparently.
Some videos are heartrending. I listened to an elderly man describe how he's living in a car on a farm, trading manual labour for a place to stay. There was a movingtribute to a departed catfrom her owner, Tyler. ""Kiko didn't make it,"" he says, holding back tears. ""It's so darn quiet without her here."" A few dozen videos I paused to watch a young ballerina float delicately across a stage, wafting back and forth in front of a hushed crowd.
""As researchers, we spend a lot of time with this stuff. It can be a lot like looking at people's personal snapshots,"" Zuckerman says. ""Most of it's boring, but sometimes it's poignant, even haunting. And every so often, you get something that feels incredibly revealing about how human beings communicate.""
But my favourite videos by far came from Bill ""The WoofDriver"" Hellman. He's a 58-year-old working in real estate just outside of Baltimore, US. But that's not his passion. What Hellman really cares about is his dogs, and the unique way he cares for them. ""You've never seen anything like this before,"" he says inone video. I guarantee that he's right.
Hellman has built over 50 custom-made vehicles that he uses to take his four huskies out for what he calls ""urban mushing"". He uses social media to document their adventures on the trails of the eastern US. It all looks a bit like the dog sled races of theIditarod. Except here, the dogs are usually strapped to the side of his various slow-moving contraptions, recumbent bicycles and electric dog-walking carts. By the looks of it Hellman's dogs are thrilled to participate.
He's posted more than 2,400 YouTube videos in the last 14 years, many of which includeoriginal rock songs. (Hellman says he's written more than 100 WoofDriver songs, in fact.) He puts in a lot of work, heading out with drones and groups of friends to document his journeys. Hellman's even paid for celebrity endorsements through the platformCameoto promote his videos. But for all the effort, his channel often gets little traction. Many videos have views in the low double digits.
""I don't get a big audience a lot of the time, but that doesn't bother me. I was just so in love with how happy it made the dogs that at some point I thought 'I gotta share this',"" Hellman says. ""Maybe it'll inspire someone to take better care of their dogs, but really, I use YouTube like the cloud, so I have a place to document my adventures.""
YouTube doesn't pay the bills, and the WoofDriver isn't selling anything – though he's happy to give you the dimensions if you want to build your own urban dog sled. ""I just do it because of the joy it brings me,"" Hellman says.
Random YouTube usually doesn't look like the highly produced videos of the WoofDriver, but he's a good representation in one sense. Like Hellman's content, the majority of these unseen YouTube videos range from neutral to overwhelmingly positive.
The same can't be said for what rises to the top.Researchsuggests YouTube's algorithmamplifies negativity, reinforcesstereotypesand gives users little control over the contentthey don't want to see. Over the years, YouTube has faced increasing criticism over concerns abouthate speech,political extremismandmisinformation. Along withother social media platforms, YouTube has been utilised bydrug cartelsandharnessed by terroristsas a tool for promotion and recruitment.
YouTube says that the company has employed a set of community guidelines since its earliest days to establish what's allowed on the platform. The company says it has redoubled efforts to address its responsibilities. One way YouTube measures its success is through its ""violative view rate"". In 2017, for every 10,000 views on YouTube, 63-72 views came from content that violated YouTube policies, but today that number has fallen to eight to nine views, according to the company.
YouTube says it gives users several ways to manage YouTube recommendations and search results, such as deleting your Watch History.
When the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure set out to study YouTube, part of the impetus was to document how common hate speech and misinformation is on the platform. ""If you go looking for it, you'll find it,"" McGrady says, but compared to the total body of videos on YouTube it's exceedingly unusual. Still, it doesn't matter how rare a damaging video is if it gets a ton of views, McGrady says, and harmful content remains a serious issue on YouTube.
In recent years, Google has faced a wave of scrutiny from policy makers, withnew lawsand a mountain ofproposed regulations– not to mention a series ofantitrust cases. But when the regulatoryconversation turns to the videoson YouTube themselves, the focus is almost always on content that goes viral, McGrady says.
This ignores the obligations YouTube should have because, according to McGrady, the company is running a piece of essential infrastructure.
More like this:
•The ghosts of India's TikTok
•Google just updated its algorithm. The internet will never be the same
•The riddles humans can solve but computers can't
""The internet is deeply troubled, and we can't ignore the way tech companies are exacerbating those problems,"" McGrady says. ""What makes me hopeful is that when you find a way to look at how people are really using the web, a lot of it still feels like the early internet. It's expression, communication, connection. Fundamentally, it's a place where regular people share themselves and do wonderful things.""
The YouTube we talk about – the one full of celebrities, scandals and manufactured virality – only tells part of the story. The majority exists in quiet moments, in shaky camera work and voices meant for no one in particular.  I watched hundreds of these videos. Everything one of them is public, but it's also clear that most people didn't upload this content for strangers. It was like being let in on a secret, a sprawling, uncurated documentary of human life. But watching it also felt like work compared to the doomscroll-inducing entertainment you get from the algorithm. Eventually, I closed my tabs and headed back to the YouTube homepage, back to the polished world of the corporate internet.
